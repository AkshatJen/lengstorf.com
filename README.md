lengstorf.com
=============

This is Jason Lengstorf's personal site. It's built on WordPress using 
[RotorWash][1] as its base theme.


Notes
-----

This theme takes advantage of the following:

*   [RotorWash][1] — A blank base theme for WordPress
*   [Fonts.com][2] — Webfonts
*   The [Twitter API][3] — So you know what I had for lunch
*   The [Instagram API][4] — To pull my latest #selfies
*   The [Dribbble API][5] — For my silly drawings

Please feel free to use parts of this code for your own projects. It would be 
awesome if you sent me a link and/or give me a shout out, but I won't hold a 
grudge if you don't.

(Okay, maybe a *little* grudge. But I'll get over it.)
