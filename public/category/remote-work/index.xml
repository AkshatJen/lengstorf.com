&lt;p&gt;Marisa is a few months into her new career as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://marisamorby.com&#34;&gt;freelance copywriter and editor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has a literature degree&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:degree&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:degree&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and hundreds of thousands of words under her belt. She&amp;rsquo;s written for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themuse.com/author/marisa-morby&#34;&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifehack.org/author/marisa-morby&#34;&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt;. She&amp;rsquo;s created an &lt;a href=&#34;http://creatingtheconversation.com/hire-probability-not-potential/&#34;&gt;information product&lt;/a&gt; and the marketing to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m telling you this to establish a fact: Marisa is extremely well-qualified to work as a copywriter. Anyone who hires her will be very happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But despite all her qualifications, her freelance career was slow out of the gate. The skill was there, but the clients weren&amp;rsquo;t piling up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-of-becoming-a-freelancer-is-sales:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;100% of Becoming a Freelancer Is Sales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend more than a few minutes skimming &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/&#34;&gt;the freelance Subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely see at least a half-dozen posts from freelancers who are struggling and unhappy because they don&amp;rsquo;t have steady work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all qualified people&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:reddit&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:reddit&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who could easily handle freelance contracts. And yet they&amp;rsquo;re stuck without work, or forced to race to the bottom on sites like Upwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these people aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;freelancers&lt;/em&gt; — they&amp;rsquo;re employees without bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freelancers are — first and foremost — salespeople.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-can-only-get-hired-if-someone-knows-you-exist:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;You Can Only Get Hired If Someone Knows You Exist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  Does anyone know you&#39;re here?

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trustcollective.com/portfolio/content/bent_drpepper.htm&#34;&gt;Bent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth about freelancing is that getting hired as a freelancer has exactly &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with your abilities as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an analogy to try and put this in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I need a deck built. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything resembling construction or woodworking since I made a lopsided toothpick box in seventh grade shop class, so I&amp;rsquo;m walking in pretty blind here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start by asking people I trust: my dad, who&amp;rsquo;s had things built before; my friends who own houses; a buddy who used to work construction. Do they know anyone I could ask about building the deck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After people I trust, I might put the word out through whatever channels are available to me. A call for help on Facebook or Twitter. Maybe someone knows someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I consult the internet at large. Are there any reviews? Who&amp;rsquo;s the best deck-builder in my city?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a list. Or, more than likely, one of my trusted sources will have a recommendation, and I&amp;rsquo;ll just go with that unquestioningly — why doubt the endorsement of someone I trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, a deck contract awarded, and I know nothing about my contractor except that my friend Troy likes him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A freelancer&amp;rsquo;s skills mean jack shit in the decision-making process for most clients.&lt;/strong&gt; You know that cheesy cliché, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you know; it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; you know&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a cliché for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;100-of-building-client-relationships-is-skill:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;100% of Building Client Relationships Is Skill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But wait,&amp;rdquo; you say, &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s so much more to freelancing than sales!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course. But none of that matters if you&amp;rsquo;re not selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where sales stop mattering is &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the sale is made. &lt;strong&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve won a client, gotten a deposit, and started a project, your sales ability can&amp;rsquo;t help you anymore — you&amp;rsquo;re on the hook to be good at your job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your talent as a freelancer will make clients happy, and it will keep them coming back. Plus, it creates referrals — which we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;selling-feels-gross:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Selling Feels Gross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look: I hate selling. &lt;em&gt;Hate it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accosting a friend or stranger and asking for money feels presumptuous, invasive, and greasy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  Selling shouldn&#39;t make you feel like this guy.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a cold call in my life.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve sent fewer than a dozen unsolicited emails asking for business. I get anxiety thinking about approaching someone who has no idea who I am and trying to convince them I&amp;rsquo;m worth money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power dynamics are weird; the approach puts me at a social disadvantage, and forces me to work extra hard to prove I know something. I would never buy something from a stranger I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of before; why would I expect anyone to buy from me when I&amp;rsquo;m a stranger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-still-have-to-own-your-position:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;You Still Have to Own Your Position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like approaching someone cold, but I have no issue whatsoever telling someone what I do — what I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s critical to fully own your ability to do the job you&amp;rsquo;re telling people you can do.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;rsquo;t trust yourself to be outstanding at your job, why should anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started freelancing full time, I waffled on what I was. Was I a guy who worked at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s and made the odd website on the side? Or was I a web designer working to bootstrap a new freelance business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like an impostor telling people I was a web designer. They&amp;rsquo;d think I was a liar if they walked into Kinko&amp;rsquo;s and saw me there, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not a healthy way to look at things. When I was younger, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t an issue for me: sure, I worked at Pizza Hut part-time, but I was a &lt;em&gt;musician&lt;/em&gt; first and foremost. My band didn&amp;rsquo;t make much money, but we practiced a few times a week and played a show every month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it was much easier to tell people I was a musician than to tell them I was a web designer.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:roles&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:roles&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was easier to call myself a musician because I had a group of friends to be part of my band, and as a freelancer I was just a guy working alone on my couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because being a freelancer seemed more important, and I was more afraid of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it was, something made me uncomfortable about saying the phrase, &amp;ldquo;I am a freelance web designer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;confidence-is-critical:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Confidence Is Critical&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally quit my job at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s to become a full-time freelancer, my confidence instantly shot through the roof. I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/&#34;&gt;set myself on fire&lt;/a&gt;, and it was time to put up or shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/i-am-really-good-at-this.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;I am really good at this. Self-confidence, freelance, sales.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  You have to believe in yourself, or no one else will.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As soon as I felt like a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; web designer, I immediately started landing more business.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think this was a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a chicken-egg problem: in order to have confidence about our abilities, we feel like we need clients; but in order to get clients, we need to have confidence in our abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to sell people my services, mind you. I simply felt more confident saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a web designer, and I can build awesome websites.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sensed my confidence, and suddenly I was being approached more often about jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/use-your-network.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Freelancers who hate selling need to use their network.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-sell-without-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;How to Sell Without Selling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems, though. I was getting approached for jobs, but that was because people knew who I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I didn&amp;rsquo;t like selling and wasn&amp;rsquo;t cold-calling people, how did anyone know who I was?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, there are two ways to get new business as a freelancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell your services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have other people sell your services for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that comfortable with option 1, so I wanted to find a way to make option 2 happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I needed to create a killer referral network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-s-still-some-selling-involved:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Still Some Selling Involved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let me mislead you into thinking you won&amp;rsquo;t have to do any selling — that&amp;rsquo;s, unfortunately, just not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to sell. But you can do a different, more comfortable kind of selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of selling to strangers, start selling to your network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

       alt=&#34;freelancers use their network to build referrals&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Never underestimate the power of word-of-mouth.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-advantage-of-your-network:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Take Advantage of Your Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people, there&amp;rsquo;s a loose network of acquaintances and &amp;ldquo;buddies&amp;rdquo; spread through the community, state, country, and/or world. Not necessarily people that you keep in touch with daily, but the kind of people you speak to every month or two — just to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-willing-to-ask-for-help:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Be Willing to Ask for Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you talk to these folks, they&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably ask you, &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s new?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, the default answer might be to say, &amp;ldquo;Not much. I&amp;rsquo;m working as a freelancer now, which is pretty exciting. How are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is factual, &lt;em&gt;but it could be much better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, look: we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to scam our friends into anything. But we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to make sure our friends are aware of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, and that they could help us do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when our friend asks, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s new?&amp;rdquo; we don&amp;rsquo;t brush the question off. Instead, we present a friendly, opt-in request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my biggest news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve just start working as a freelance web designer, which is pretty exciting. The biggest challenge so far is finding clients, so if you know anyone who needs a website, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you&amp;rsquo;d drop my name or make an intro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You haven&amp;rsquo;t asked for anything that puts your friend out. All you&amp;rsquo;re doing is putting it in her head that she can help you out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the deck analogy from earlier? People love to have the answers to other people&amp;rsquo;s problems. &lt;strong&gt;If my friend can connect me to someone who needs my services, she wins twice:&lt;/strong&gt; she helped me grow my business, and helped her other friend solve their website problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-don-t-have-to-wait-for-an-opening:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Have to Wait for an Opening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also start this conversation. Email your acquaintances to catch them up on things, including a nudge to send any potential leads your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That email is almost the same. It might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, friend–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well! I wanted to drop you a line to see how things are going and catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Talk about things that are relevant: do they have kids? were they starting something new last time you spoke?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things on my end are pretty exciting right now. My biggest news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve just start working as a freelance web designer. The biggest challenge so far is finding clients, so if you know anyone who needs a website, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it if you&amp;rsquo;d drop my name or make an intro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Catch them up on anything else in your life that you want to share here.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope you&amp;rsquo;re having an awesome summer. I&amp;rsquo;ll look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message isn&amp;rsquo;t hiding an agenda. You&amp;rsquo;re not trying to weasel something out of a friend. You&amp;rsquo;re simply sharing big life news and making it known that — if they happen to hear someone needs a website — they can help you out by spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you sent this message without the note about referring leads, it would still be a meaningful message to you and your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remember-these-are-your-friends:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Remember: These Are Your Friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big goal, of course, is not to be a dick about this. You are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to get good results by pestering everyone you know about buying a website to &amp;ldquo;help you out&amp;rdquo; or whatever. That&amp;rsquo;s multi-level marketing — are you a freelancer, or are you hawking Scentsy candles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you send an email, make sure you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be upset if you received the same email from your friend.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to be made aware that someone is looking for work; it&amp;rsquo;s another thing entirely to be pumped for leads and/or pressured into buying things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be fine if you just follow Wheaton&amp;rsquo;s Law: &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t be a dick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grow-your-network:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Grow Your Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to your existing network, make an effort to meet people — especially people who are in the industries you&amp;rsquo;d like to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the added benefit of building a community. You can help people in whatever way you&amp;rsquo;re able, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to reciprocate as best as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  In Missoula, running a small workshop in 2010.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started out, I started attending a small group called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Montana-Programmers/&#34;&gt;MT Programmers&lt;/a&gt; in Missoula. &lt;strong&gt;I started to get involved, and through the people I met there, I was introduced to more and more people in the community&lt;/strong&gt; — more than a few of my first gigs came from these introductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I spent money to attend conferences, and &lt;strong&gt;I found myself surrounded by people who were focusing on their businesses and willing to spend money to get what they needed&lt;/strong&gt; — often, this meant they needed website help, so it naturally came up in conversation that we could help each other out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bring-your-clients-into-your-network:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Bring Your Clients into Your Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I get a new project, I bust my ass to make sure the client is really happy with me. I know that &lt;strong&gt;happy clients are worth &lt;em&gt;way more&lt;/em&gt; than just the value of a given project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients became life-long friends. I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to book launch parties, weddings, vacations, and more. This could never have happened if I didn&amp;rsquo;t show that I&amp;rsquo;m a stand-up guy through my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a financial perspective, lots of my clients came back later with additional projects. Far more of them referred friends and colleagues to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-clients-for-referrals:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Ask Clients for Referrals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my wrapping-up process with clients is to send an email letting them know that I don&amp;rsquo;t advertise, and the only way I get new clients is by word-of-mouth from my existing clients. I ask them — if they feel like I did a good job and they&amp;rsquo;re happy with my work — to please keep me in mind if they meet someone else who needs a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also offer a referral bonus as a token of my appreciation. It&amp;rsquo;s not much — $100 for any referral who signs on with me — but I like to send it over as a token of my appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make sure to send a personal note thanking the person for each referral as well, except in the case of my highest-referring clients — they send too many leads, so I&amp;rsquo;d be spamming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;eventually-you-can-stop-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Eventually You Can Stop Selling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple years, &lt;strong&gt;I had a large enough network that my referral stream was too much for me to handle.&lt;/strong&gt; I received several inquiries a week from people who were serious about web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was swamped. I had to hire subcontractors to help. I had a waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;this meant I never had to go out and &amp;ldquo;do sales&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; the way that freelancers typically view sales. No cold calls or emails, no advertising, no proposals. Just a steady stream of referrals — which is a different (far less awkward) type of selling.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;freelancing-is-for-conversationalists:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;Freelancing Is for Conversationalists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s direct sales or leveraging a network for introductions, &lt;strong&gt;your job as a freelancer is to generate conversations with people who may need your services.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that your ability to speak in a clear and friendly manner is perhaps your most valuable skill. If you sound confident, and you don&amp;rsquo;t seem like a dick, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ll get the job over someone who seems unsure or comes off as abrasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As unfair as it may seem, a freelancer with better conversational skills will likely win a job over a more competent freelancer who speaks poorly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-be-successful-without-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8&#34;&gt;You Can Be Successful Without Selling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a slower road than hard selling, but you can successfully build a freelance career only by networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your friends know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them to refer anyone who might need your services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go out and meet people — especially if they&amp;rsquo;re in your target demographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be helpful and confident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kick ass for your clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them for referrals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a referral network after my first project, and it grew steadily with each new project I took on. It seemed to me that most projects would lead to one referral, and every once in a while a project would lead to a huge number of referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you hate sales, don&amp;rsquo;t worry — you can still be a freelancer. You may need to hold onto your day job a bit longer, but you can get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stay confident, ask for leads, and remember that your skills finish the job and earn new referrals — so do good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls&#34;&gt;These work. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; make cold calls. I just never liked the idea of becoming a telemarketer for my own services, so I worked around the problem.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating&#34;&gt;I think of it like dating, because to me it&amp;rsquo;s kind of the same thing. I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had success approaching a stranger and wooing her. However, if I get introduced by a mutual friend, I feel far less awkward and there&amp;rsquo;s a much higher chance that we&amp;rsquo;ll hit it off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think this happens because the introduction creates a reason for me to be there. My friend has vouched for me, and this means the conversation starts on level ground — I don&amp;rsquo;t have to prove I deserve to be there, and the conversation can progress naturally.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How I Freelance from Anywhere in the World: Audio Interview</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/how-to-freelance-anywhere-in-the-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 09:14:07 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lengstorf.com/how-to-freelance-anywhere-in-the-world/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A little while back, I got an email from an anonymous email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy — let&amp;rsquo;s call him &amp;ldquo;John&amp;rdquo; — had a lot of questions about how I was actually making my lifestyle work. Never mind the travel tips, he said, I want to know how you &lt;em&gt;make money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked John if he&amp;rsquo;d be willing to get on a call with me and let me record our conversation. He agreed, and we talked for about 50 minutes. John grilled me on how I got started, how long it took me to break even, and how I keep things moving now that I&amp;rsquo;m half a world away from the people I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206033656&amp;color=e26700&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The audio ends rather abruptly; John wanted to ask a couple questions off the record (that were very specific to his own situation), so I cut the audio off there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve summarized what we talked about on the call. John&amp;rsquo;s questions are the headlines, and my (heavily paraphrased) responses are the text in each section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

       alt=&#34;How to Freelance from Anywhere in the World&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-actual-nature-of-the-work-you-re-doing:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Is the Actual Nature of the Work You&amp;rsquo;re Doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I work as a freelance web developer, but I have a single long-term contract with one client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day-to-day tasks center around software research and development: I build experimental apps quickly to test new ideas (kind of a one-man &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project&#34;&gt;skunkworks&lt;/a&gt;). I try out something crazy on a small alpha audience, and if it proves viable, the project is handed off to the production team as a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project with dedicated resources and so on.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-to-the-point-of-feeling-established:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get to the Point of Feeling &amp;ldquo;Established&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a year and a half of going full-time freelance, I was able to make about $30K/year. For me, who had no family, debt, or much overhead at all, was more than enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-started:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get Started?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got interested in web design when I was playing in a band. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to hire help, so I volunteered myself to do design when we needed it. It stayed interesting, so I kept learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the band broke up, I was still interested in web design. I built a website for a close friend of mine, which led to leads for a couple local websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those leads gave me the opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/&#34;&gt;quit my day job and freelance full-time&lt;/a&gt;. I took the plunge, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been my own boss ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-your-business-grew-organically:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;So Your Business Grew Organically?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I had to take work wherever I could find it, and I spent a lot of time chasing leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, though, I started to get emails from people asking about websites. Most of them were health and fitness professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my work for Nate — the first website I ever built that wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me — and due largely in part to Nate&amp;rsquo;s incredible success in the health and fitness sector as a journalist, I was introduced to a few up-and-coming fitness pros who needed websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built sites for John Romaniello, Tony Gentilcore, and Mike Robertson. They all had (or would soon have) enormous online presence, and their recommendations carried a lot of weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys were rising stars in the industry. They were speaking at conferences, writing articles, getting interviewed in major publications — they were the connectors, to put it into &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point#The_three_rules&#34;&gt;Gladwellian terms&lt;/a&gt;. Other people looking to make it as fitness pros asked my clients for advice, and when it came to web design, my name was dropped frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned into a very strong referral network that became effective enough over time that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go looking for clients anymore; I had 3–5 new leads coming to me each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become &amp;ldquo;the guy for that&amp;rdquo; — this has been the ultimate secret to my success. I have become dependably excellent in my area of expertise: my clients could trust me to solve their problems effectively without requiring much of their time. That trust led them to continue working with me and referring me to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-long-did-it-take-before-you-felt-comfortable:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Long Did It Take Before You Felt Comfortable?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about a year and a half to get to the point where I was making $30K/year. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything extravagant, but I was able to live comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealing-with-dry-months:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Dealing with Dry Months&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things were rough for me, starting out, was when I had a slow month. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think ahead and put money aside when I had good months, so the dry months were rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have solved that problem fast, had I been a little smarter about things, and it would have made me far more stable as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was dumb, so I&amp;rsquo;d have a good month and — instead of putting it away to cover a slow month later — I&amp;rsquo;d say, &amp;ldquo;Fuck yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s go to Hawaii!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-gain-the-technical-competency-to-get-where-you-are-now:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Gain the Technical Competency to Get Where You Are Now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really curious about how things work, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s probably the single biggest advantage I have in life.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being generally curious, I also had a need: my band needed a website if we were going to tour effectively, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I learned to customize a MySpace page. Then I built a crappy website after a shitload of Googling. I built it again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would come up against a problem that we needed to solve, and then I would find a way to solve it. It was fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hubris-of-being-19:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;The Hubris of Being 19&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious about how to make more powerful tools, and I needed to find a way to let my clients update their own websites without requiring me to go in and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of the open source community at this time, or of WordPress. Plus, I was a cocky teenager who thought I could build something better than anything else that was out there — so I built a CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a terrible business plan, but an excellent learning tool. As a result I understand a lot of what happens behind the scenes in a tool like WordPress or Ghost, and when those tools don&amp;rsquo;t do what I need them to do, I can usually figure out a way to build something new to solve my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-marketing-skills-in-combination-with-the-tech-skills:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get Marketing Skills in Combination with the Tech Skills?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have this delusional belief that — if I continue to study — eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll understand everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of my clients work in the same industry, I saw them all running up against the same kinds of problems. I also saw what was working for my more successful clients, and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the clients who were struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I love learning how things work, I started to dig into the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of it all. I saw patterns emerging, and I learned how to apply what I learned to new clients in a way that helped them grow their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had marketing experience out of the necessity of being a broke musician. I had to figure out a way to convince high school kids to come pay $5 to watch a band they&amp;rsquo;d never heard of before from Montana — it was a good primer on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, on bigger projects, I&amp;rsquo;d hire experts to come in and set up complicated marketing efforts, and I&amp;rsquo;d watch what they did and keep asking why they were doing it. So even when I didn&amp;rsquo;t do the work myself, I tried to continue learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-would-you-design-your-own-curriculum-for-getting-a-skill-set:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Would You Design Your Own Curriculum for Getting a Skill Set?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical side is the biggest job pool, but you can find non-technical jobs as well: customer support, executive assistants, writers, accountants, lawyers — the world is set up to make most knowledge work possible remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go the tech route, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to figure out how you learn best: some people get the most out of reading tutorials and documentation; others have better luck with video instruction like &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;; and then there&amp;rsquo;s always something to be said for learning in an in-person, hands-on environment.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hands-on training, there are a lot of new bootcamps popping up all over. In Portland, for example, you can take a four-month course through &lt;a href=&#34;http://epicodus.com&#34;&gt;Epicodus&lt;/a&gt; that guarantees real-world job experience through an internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-technical careers, start looking for jobs on the many job boards out there, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://remoteok.io/&#34;&gt;remoteok.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://weworkremotely.com/&#34;&gt;weworkremotely.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wfh.io/&#34;&gt;wfh.io&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the listings are for tech jobs, but there are a good number of support, content, marketing, and human resources jobs posted as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-hurdles:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Are the Hurdles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily the biggest hurdle to making it as a freelancer is your own temperament. Are you excited about your work and eager to get tasks knocked out? Or are you more likely to need someone cracking the whip over you before you&amp;rsquo;ll get things done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Further reading: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/scheduling-maximum-productivity/&#34;&gt;Get More Done Faster — Scheduling for Maximum Productivity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;breaking-into-the-industry:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Breaking into the Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep doing projects in the industry. If you have to start out doing free work, do it. But try to get paid every time — you&amp;rsquo;re providing a service, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to learn cars, I&amp;rsquo;d buy books, hang out with my more mechanically inclined friends, bother my mechanic with questions about what he was doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d start with small projects: changing my own oil or changing the tires. Then I&amp;rsquo;d graduate up to more difficult tasks — my ultimate aim would be to know enough to take the car apart and put it back together again, and I&amp;rsquo;d get there one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a project that&amp;rsquo;s about 10% above your skill level and take it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/&#34;&gt;Set yourself on fire&lt;/a&gt; to learn the new skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10% beyond your skill set, there&amp;rsquo;s very little risk that you&amp;rsquo;ll be unable to figure it out; where the risk comes in is if you get too ambitious and do something that requires learning several layers of skills to complete — taking a job as a lifeguard before you&amp;rsquo;ve learned to swim, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a balance between challenging and &amp;ldquo;in way over my head&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-mutually-intelligible-are-programming-languages:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Mutually Intelligible Are Programming Languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages share ideas. JavaScript and PHP have different syntax, but a lot of the concepts carry through. Each programming language is usually created by taking a programmer&amp;rsquo;s idea of the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; features of any number of existing programming languages, and adding or removing features as they see fit.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to build the mental models at first, which is the hard part. After that you&amp;rsquo;ll start to see patterns emerge. It starts out feeling like total nonsense, but similarities show up, and concepts cross languages. You&amp;rsquo;ll find that each new language you learn takes a lot less time than the one before it did.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-you-see-in-the-future-and-how-are-you-positioning-yourself-what-s-your-relationship-with-new-tools:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Do You See in the Future, and How Are You Positioning Yourself? What&amp;rsquo;s Your Relationship with New Tools?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to find a balance between using tools that solve problems (WordPress will solve many of your problems very quickly) and learning how things work (understand that WordPress is built in PHP, and if you know PHP you can get WordPress to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; rather than being limited by WordPress plugins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-approach-data-security:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Do You Approach Data Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate in that most of what I do isn&amp;rsquo;t sensitive. (The most sensitive data I deal with is email addresses — and I try to avoid even dealing with those.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tunnelbear.com/&#34;&gt;TunnelBear&lt;/a&gt; as a simple, cheap &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network&#34;&gt;VPN&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple solution that will do a pretty good job of protecting my data without making security an additional job for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.tt/gPmxlbE&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;disclosure: if you sign up with that link, I get bonus storage&lt;/em&gt;) to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t lose any data — I could drop my computer off a cliff and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose any of my files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-long-do-you-intend-to-travel:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Long Do You Intend to Travel?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a definite answer to this question. I intend to travel for as long as travel seems like the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always checking in with myself: am I doing this because I&amp;rsquo;ve convinced myself that I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person that travels, or because it actually makes me happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time may come in a decade, a year, a month — or tomorrow — when I decide that I&amp;rsquo;d be happier if I was in one place instead of moving every few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t see an end in sight. I expect I&amp;rsquo;ll be traveling for at least the next couple years unless something unexpected happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-overcome-the-absence-of-in-person-interaction:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Do You Overcome the Absence of In-Person Interaction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John asks, &amp;ldquo;How do you make sure people remember you when you&amp;rsquo;re not in the room? If your best impression is face-to-face, how do you preserve that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I build my business as a &amp;ldquo;remote first&amp;rdquo; workplace. I&amp;rsquo;ve always worked with people without regard for geographical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I would only correspond with my clients by email, but there were drawbacks to this: my relationships were weak and strictly business, and it can be hard to communicate tone effectively. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;d think I was making a silly joke, and my client would think I was being a dick; other times, I&amp;rsquo;d think my client was unhappy, but they&amp;rsquo;d just responded in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I require phone calls (preferably video calls) for big deliverables and check-ins. This allows me to walk through what I did and why, and gather feedback in realtime. It also allows discussion, just like a face-to-face meeting would. You lose the stiffness of email, and you build a real connection with your clients. This has resolved a lot of conflicts before they had a chance to start — it&amp;rsquo;s easy to yell in an email; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to yell at someone who&amp;rsquo;s right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do try to show up where my clients are from time to time. If I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be somewhere that a client lives, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to meet them for dinner or coffee. When a conference is happening where a good group of my clients is planning to show up, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can make it work. Even with video calls, there&amp;rsquo;s a huge amount of added value in just spending time with people, in person, without any agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-yourself-useful:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Make Yourself Useful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I meet a potential client, I don&amp;rsquo;t try to sell them something. I just share a solution if I have one.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This establishes me as an expert and — even if they don&amp;rsquo;t hire me — they&amp;rsquo;ll remember that I was able to help them out. If they meet someone who needs help in the future, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a referral, and if they need to hire help in the future they&amp;rsquo;ll think of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-questions-do-you-have-about-going-location-independent:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Questions Do You Have About Going Location-Independent?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John had questions that centered largely around technical skills, running a freelance business, and client acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What questions do you have about becoming location-independent? Click the discussion link and fire away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;For the technically inclined, I&amp;rsquo;m working heavily in realtime video right now: Node.js, Socket.IO, WebRTC powering the back-end, and a plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS UI.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;My dad would play the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; game in reverse when I was growing up. Whenever I had a chore, or a homework assignment, or anything at all, really, my dad would ask me how it was done. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get away with cop-out answers: I needed to have a thorough understanding of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; priming a lawn mower helped it start; or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was faster to sweep out the garage if I followed a pattern instead of whisking the dirt around haphazardly; &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the lights turned on when I flipped the switch. As a kid, it was fucking infuriating; as an adult, I don&amp;rsquo;t think any other single factor has contributed as much to my success as my ingrained habit of asking why something works (or doesn&amp;rsquo;t) instead of shrugging and continuing about my business.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;In the audio, I refer to &amp;ldquo;Code School&amp;rdquo; in Portland as a bootcamp. It&amp;rsquo;s actually called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epicodus.com/&#34;&gt;Epicodus&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;I had some of my facts wrong in the audio interview. I talked about languages having ancestors, which isn&amp;rsquo;t correct. &lt;a href=&#34;https://line.do/ww/history-of-php/r5q4x1/vertical&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; in C. JavaScript is a standard of its own, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005729/what-language-is-javascript-written-in&#34;&gt;interpreters&lt;/a&gt; that are written in C, C++, Java, or even — in truly meta fashion — JavaScript.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested this theory, but I have a hunch this applies to spoken language as well. I&amp;rsquo;m getting better at Spanish, and just barely starting to learn French; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily feel &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; to learn French, but I have some strategies and constructs in place that are definitely helpful.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;Sharing a solution is very different from doing actual work. If we&amp;rsquo;re talking and I can help you out by just rattling off some knowledge I have that applies to your situation, then I&amp;rsquo;ll do that. But I won&amp;rsquo;t pull out my laptop and solve the problem for you unless we work out a budget and scope first.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How to Use Airbnb Like a Pro: Save Money &amp; Avoid Surprises</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/use-airbnb-like-a-pro/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; is near the top of my list of the greatest things to happen to the world in the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy&#34;&gt;sharing economy&lt;/a&gt; has made it incredibly easy to save money by renting other people&amp;rsquo;s unused things. Airbnb and competitors like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vrbo.com/&#34;&gt;VRBO&lt;/a&gt; do this by allowing people to rent out their extra space — from a spare room to an empty home — to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/how-to-book-airbnb-like-a-pro.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;How to book the best Airbnb listings.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This photo is from a listing I booked in Madrid. (Thanks Enrique!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/991697&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;airbnb-a-hotel-that-doesn-t-suck:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Airbnb: A Hotel that Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Suck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a hotel that doesn&amp;rsquo;t smell like industrial-strength cleaner is expensive. And finding one that&amp;rsquo;s comfortable enough to live in for a long period of time is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb offers the ability to find a place to stay that feels less like a filing cabinet for tourists and more like a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(If you&amp;rsquo;ve never stayed at an Airbnb before, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;get $25 off your first rental using this link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the most out of Airbnb can be tricky. But it&amp;rsquo;s not hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;define-what-matters:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Define What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start traveling, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to come up with a list of what you need in order to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: &lt;strong&gt;long-term travel is very different from a weekend stay.&lt;/strong&gt; Something that might not bother you on a quick trip, such as a shaky internet connection, will be a big problem if you&amp;rsquo;re there for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest with yourself about what you need in order to feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the list is pretty short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want an entire place to myself — shared rooms are for very short stays only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wifi needs to be fast and reliable — without it, I can&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bed needs to be comfortable and at least queen-sized&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86:bed&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86:bed&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temperature control for the room is essential — I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep when I&amp;rsquo;m too hot or cold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The location needs to be within walking distance of both good restaurants and coffee shops with wifi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a washing machine in the unit is ideal since I only have 5 days&amp;rsquo; worth of clothing (in a pinch, I can do without this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else is negotiable. By figuring out what my non-negotiable items are, I can quickly remove options that would stress me out while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-your-filters-appropriately:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Set Your Filters Appropriately&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb has a very simple search interface, but if you&amp;rsquo;re not paying attention it may look like you&amp;rsquo;re only able to search for a date range and what kind of room you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click the &amp;ldquo;more filters&amp;rdquo; button, though, &lt;strong&gt;you can filter by amenities&lt;/strong&gt; ranging from wireless internet and air conditioning to a gym or a doorman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/how-to-use-airbnb-filters.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Use Airbnb filters to find the best extended rental.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Airbnb&#39;s amenity filters on desktop (left) and mobile (right) are easy to use.

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you like to cook? Make sure they have an oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling with a dog? Check the &amp;ldquo;pets allowed&amp;rdquo; filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the filters, you can quickly exclude any listings that don&amp;rsquo;t meet your needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;confirm-the-non-negotiables-with-the-host:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Confirm the Non-Negotiables with the Host&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After filtering down the listings that definitely aren&amp;rsquo;t what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a few additional items on your list that you need to verify. &lt;strong&gt;Send the host a message to ask any clarifying questions or to verify information about the listing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I always verify wifi speed before committing to a place by asking the host to run a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.speedtest.net/&#34;&gt;speed test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things aren&amp;rsquo;t selectable by the filters, such as the size of the bed, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to check with the host about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-a-feel-for-your-host-before-you-book:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Get a Feel for Your Host Before You Book&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve decided that a place is probably a good fit, Airbnb encourages you to book immediately — don&amp;rsquo;t do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/booking-on-airbnb-contact-host.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Use the contact host button on Airbnb to make sure the listing is good for you.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;strong&gt;use the small &amp;ldquo;contact the host&amp;rdquo; link below the &amp;ldquo;About This Listing&amp;rdquo; box to send a message to the host&lt;/strong&gt; — including the dates you want to book — without making a commitment. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to put money down before you&amp;rsquo;re sure the host is responsive and able to answer any questions you have clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;read-the-reviews:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Read the Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the person renting the space and the person who owns the space are encouraged to review each other after a stay, so you&amp;rsquo;re able to read what fellow travelers thought about the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading reviews can help you spot potential problems before you book.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep an eye out for red flags like issues contacting the host, problems with amenities that you care about, or comments about the general neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of reviews (and cumulative ratings) are also a good indicator of whether you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with someone who frequently has renters or if it&amp;rsquo;s someone who may lack experience in dealing with guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed with both types of people and enjoyed the space, but there&amp;rsquo;s something to be said about the comfort of booking a listing with dozens of five-star reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-your-ideal-hotel-to-home-ratio:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Find Your Ideal Hotel-to-Home Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain aspects of the hotel experience that are really pleasant: knowing your room will be cleaned each day, having fresh towels, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you ask for it ahead of time, you can often arrange to have the good parts of a hotel-like experience in your Airbnb rental.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to be aware of is cleaning. A lot of rentals don&amp;rsquo;t have a cleaning service, so if you&amp;rsquo;re staying for longer than a couple weeks, you&amp;rsquo;ll either have to clean it yourself or work out a deal with the owner to provide cleaning services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually ask if there&amp;rsquo;s a cleaning service, and if not, I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;strong&gt;arrange with the landlord to have the place cleaned every week or two&lt;/strong&gt; while I&amp;rsquo;m staying there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this at my first couple locations, and it sucked. I hate mopping floors and changing sheets, so I&amp;rsquo;m more than willing to pay a little extra to have it done for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speed-things-up-with-a-message-template:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Speed Things Up with a Message Template&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;save time by creating a template for contacting hosts&lt;/strong&gt; that introduces yourself and communicates your non-negotiable items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here&amp;rsquo;s the message I send to each host before I book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend, Marisa, and I have been looking at your listing, and we love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are spending all of 2015 traveling around the world, renting Airbnb apartments in the cities we want to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re both so grateful that people like you have opened your homes to travelers, because without you, our adventure wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible. So thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re very interested in renting your apartment, but I wanted to ask a couple questions first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we both work from our computers and will be working while we travel. Since our jobs rely on an internet connection, could you please let us know how fast and reliable the wifi connection is at your apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure how fast it is, could you please search Google for &amp;ldquo;speed test by ookla&amp;rdquo; and click the first result? On that site, click the &amp;ldquo;Begin Test&amp;rdquo; button to check the connection&amp;rsquo;s speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, since we&amp;rsquo;re planning to stay for an extended period, we&amp;rsquo;re interested in negotiating additional cleaning fees so we could have the apartment serviced every two weeks. Would that be a possibility?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ ADD A PERSONAL NOTE ABOUT THE AREA AND/OR THE LISTING HERE ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again. We&amp;rsquo;ll look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason &amp;amp; Marisa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;save-more-money:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Save (More) Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay $1,500/month in rent, that&amp;rsquo;s about $50/night to stay in your own apartment. (This, of course, isn&amp;rsquo;t even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/cost-of-living-remotely/&#34;&gt;full price you pay to live in your apartment&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hotel, by contrast, is probably going to cost at least $100/night unless it&amp;rsquo;s, well, &lt;em&gt;gross.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb has never failed to find me a place to stay that was cheaper than a hotel room, and I&amp;rsquo;ve nearly always found a place that cost less per night than my rent in Portland.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it turns out you can save even more by being on top of your booking and taking advantage of Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s price breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;longer-stays-cost-less:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Longer Stays Cost Less&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Airbnb shows the cost of a listing per night. For example, at the time of writing, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5234548&#34;&gt;this listing in Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; costs $82/night if you book it for six nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;if you book the same listing for a week, the cost drops&lt;/strong&gt; to $71/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you book for a month, the cost drops further&lt;/strong&gt; to $51/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all Airbnb listings have breaks for longer stays, but when you search for longer stays, the ones that offer breaks are easy to spot by their lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can stay put for a month, you stand to save a bundle by taking advantage of Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s price breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;book-way-in-advance-for-better-cheap-options:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Book Way in Advance for Better Cheap Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one of each place, so when it&amp;rsquo;s booked, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice listings with low prices will be the first to go, so if you&amp;rsquo;re sure of your travel plans way ahead of time, you should &lt;strong&gt;book early to make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got your pick of the best locations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;airbnb-is-the-perfect-solution-for-extended-travel:91cf14a7277c97ff0685dd4a8db8db86&#34;&gt;Airbnb Is the Perfect Solution for Extended Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to spend all their time living in hotel rooms. Using Airbnb is a great way to live like a local would — after all, you&amp;rsquo;re borrowing a local&amp;rsquo;s home — and avoid the temporary feeling that can lead to homesickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, in combination with the potential to save &lt;em&gt;a lot of money&lt;/em&gt;, is why I&amp;rsquo;m convinced &lt;strong&gt;Airbnb is the perfect tool for &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/&#34;&gt;location-independent&lt;/a&gt; workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Don&amp;rsquo;t forget: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;sign up for Airbnb with this link get $25 toward your first rental&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>How to Avoid Paying Foreign Transaction Fees While Traveling</title>

&lt;p&gt;Before you leave the country, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to make sure that you can access your money while abroad without paying outrageous fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s your money — you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing a little extra legwork ahead of time, however, you can easily avoid foreign transaction and ATM fees, as well as set yourself up to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; money by taking advantage of travel-friendly rewards programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

       alt=&#34;How to Avoid Foreign Transaction Fees While Traveling Abroad&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/8273660863/in/photolist-chEwR9-bH1iX8-bt4mNt-42PQoC-a2YSa6-62QVKf-bta55K-82xTtv-5EMAYS-dB7F8e-dK2oa7-aFDjPB-aYWk56-aFATbM-aFAaK6-aFAQEv-PNrwk-84wJAM-QxcaH-apUnh-3q1C3-82zjvr-bZvUDS-2Bvzr6-bta3kH-5rzm-abWteX-7HKuTk-h3Hnof-brd1K2-62LFqP-5dTR5Y-cMnty-dTUAhR-5p8w8o-2BUQXp-7jm7SP-aah9wX-8F5t1j-dSZe91-dUSc9a-a5SwX-dSK3tm-5CeF99-biaRHp-68vjKV-68zxeQ-5TWEfA-9C9vCS-aFAPtx&#34;&gt;Moyan Brenn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-a-bank-account-without-foreign-atm-fees:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Open a Bank Account without Foreign ATM Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick way to rack up enormous fees is to pull money out of a foreign ATM from an account that charges foreign transaction fees. A lot of accounts will hit you with an extra fee of up to $5 for each withdrawal — this is in addition to the ATM fee itself, which can get spendy ($6 in Thailand, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving your spending money into a checking account without foreign ATM fees will save you hundreds of dollars each year,&lt;/strong&gt; because you&amp;rsquo;ll always want to pull out money in the local currency when you arrive in a new country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m only going to talk about the account I use myself, but The Points Guy has put together a good list of &lt;a href=&#34;http://thepointsguy.com/2014/02/the-top-11-checking-accounts-for-avoiding-foreign-atm-fees/&#34;&gt;other options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;schwab-investor-checking:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Schwab Investor Checking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the Schwab Investor Checking account because I liked the idea of an entirely online bank account. They let me deposit checks through my phone, and I can transfer money to the account from any of my other bank accounts — for free — using their transfer setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, the Investor Checking doesn&amp;rsquo;t charge foreign ATM fees, the debit card they send has a chip (more on this below), and they even reimburse the ATM fees charged at the ATM.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3:feereimbursement&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3:feereimbursement&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have killer chat support if you have questions — I once started out with questions about setting up an automatic transfer and ended by asking a bunch of Investment 101 questions. The agent was smart and super helpful; he even gave me the name of a restaurant to try in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account&#34;&gt;Get details on Schwab Investor Checking and open an account.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-a-local-bank-account:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Keep a &amp;ldquo;Local&amp;rdquo; Bank Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get checks in the mail — whether it&amp;rsquo;s from a client, a tax refund, or a birthday card from your grandmother made out for the age you just turned — it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes handy to ask your contact person back home (I send mail to my parents, but you can also get a virtual assistant or your accountant to handle this for a fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason I keep a Wells Fargo account open. I figure that way I can find a branch anywhere in the US, which means my contact person, or myself if I&amp;rsquo;m in-country for some reason, can quickly drop into a branch to deposit a check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve had very little reason to use this account, but for the once or twice I have, it&amp;rsquo;s been worth keeping it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-credit-cards-with-no-foreign-transaction-fees:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Use Credit Cards with No Foreign Transaction Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not paying attention, you may get dinged for an additional 3% of &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; purchase made outside the United States on your credit card. That adds up fast when you travel often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a large number of credit cards without foreign transaction fees. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about &lt;strong&gt;the two credit cards I actually use.&lt;/strong&gt; For a compiled list of all the cards available, NerdWallet has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/no-foreign-transaction-fee-credit-card/&#34;&gt;solid roundup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chase-sapphire-preferred:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Chase Sapphire Preferred&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is my card of choice when traveling. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card.aspx&#34;&gt;rewards are great&lt;/a&gt;, and the annual fee is cheap ($99). So far this year I&amp;rsquo;ve already made enough in rewards to pay back the fee and then some, and since I pay off my credit card balance in full every month, I&amp;rsquo;m effectively getting paid to use this credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no foreign transaction fees or currency exchange fees, and the rewards system is specifically geared toward travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, it&amp;rsquo;s a Visa card with a chip, so I&amp;rsquo;ve never had an issue using it to pay — if the business accepts cards, this one will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?PID=CFFD2&amp;amp;SPID=FDY7&amp;amp;CELL=6RLJ&amp;amp;MSC=1440684963&#34;&gt;Apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(If you apply through this link, you get a 40,000 point bonus, and I get a 5,000 point bonus. Win-win!)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;delta-skymiles-american-express:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Delta SkyMiles American Express&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My backup credit card is the Platinum Delta SkyMiles American Express, which has excellent benefits if you fly Delta frequently. There are pretty sizable mileage bonuses if you hit set spending thresholds each year — you can get to the Silver Medallion level almost without getting on a plane using this card — and it gives you double miles for any Delta purchase, plus 1-to-1 miles-for-dollars rewards for everything you spend on the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this card&amp;rsquo;s help, I&amp;rsquo;ve had Platinum status on Delta for a while now, and the advantage of priority security line access alone is worth the membership fee for the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are no extra fees for using the card abroad — the only challenge is that it&amp;rsquo;s American Express, so it&amp;rsquo;s not accepted everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www304.americanexpress.com/credit-card/skymiles/25330&#34;&gt;Learn more about the Platinum Delta SkyMiles American Express card and apply.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus-tip-switch-to-chip-cards-before-you-leave:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;Bonus Tip: Switch to Chip Cards Before You Leave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is behind the rest of the world in credit card security, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2014/10/21/is-the-us-finally-accelerating-a-move-to-chip-and-pin/&#34;&gt;that appears to be changing soon&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the world, for the most part, uses chip and PIN cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to travel outside the US, a magnetic stripe card is likely to confuse the hell out of the kid making your coffee, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get chip cards before you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, thanks to the impending chip card switch-over in the US, many banks are already issuing chip cards, and the ones who aren&amp;rsquo;t will probably do so if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called about all of my credit and debit cards before I left, and had no issues getting a chip card issued in most cases. The exceptions were Discover&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3:discover&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3:discover&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and my local credit union. The rest of my cards were quickly reissued — without changing the card number — and I had switched over to chip cards within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-upfront-prep-will-save-you-hundreds-of-dollars:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3&#34;&gt;A Little Upfront Prep Will Save You Hundreds of Dollars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking a bit of time to get your money organized in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost you extra to access while traveling, you can save yourself a huge amount of headache (and dollars) once you&amp;rsquo;ve set out on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:d4615bebf8fa92a14f2b6cbb1693cba3:feereimbursement&#34;&gt;I think there might be a minimum balance requirement before ATM fees are reimbursed. They don&amp;rsquo;t charge any ATM fees on their end at any point, though.

      <title>Travel Essentials: How to Set Up a Mobile Phone Abroad</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/how-to-mobile-phone-abroad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 06:44:03 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since having a mobile phone is now more or less a requirement for being a functional member of society, it&amp;rsquo;s important to find a way to get your hands on a phone while abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key benefit to having a working phone is access to wireless data, which is invaluable when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to navigate a new city where the street signs aren&amp;rsquo;t in English, or if you need to quickly look up how to say &amp;ldquo;coconut oil&amp;rdquo; in Thai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the benefits of data, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to receive calls and texts from your friends and family in your home country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a slightly confusing setup — I&amp;rsquo;ll explain thoroughly, I promise — you can keep a local number while abroad, complete with text and picture message, while also setting up a local phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s all &lt;em&gt;way cheaper&lt;/em&gt; than a mobile contract in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/how-to-set-up-a-mobile-phone-abroad.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;How to set up a mobile phone while traveling abroad.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-an-unlocked-phone-with-a-sim-card-slot:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Buy an Unlocked Phone with a SIM Card Slot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve got your phone numbers and forwarding worked out, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a phone that works in all the countries you want to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most US mobile carriers subsidize the cost of phones with contracts, the phones they sell are locked — this makes them useless if they&amp;rsquo;re not on that carrier&amp;rsquo;s network and plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To avoid insane roaming fees, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to buy an unlocked phone.&lt;/strong&gt; When you see the cost of an unlocked phone, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably shit your pants — just remember that when you &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; a phone with a contract, you&amp;rsquo;re also committing to about $1,200 in phone bills over the next year, so a $600 phone isn&amp;rsquo;t actually that expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the phone you buy allows you to swap out the SIM card, and that it will work on GSM networks. If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure what that means, do a search for the phone model you want to buy and whether or not it works in the countries you want to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1GyjrWh&#34;&gt;purchased an unlocked iPhone 6&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s worked in the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia without any issues so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-a-prepaid-sim-card-once-you-land:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Buy a Prepaid SIM Card Once You Land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out how cheap it was to have a prepaid SIM in other countries, I spent a half-hour ranting about how criminal the mobile carrier racket is in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve left the United States, I have spent less than $40/month on prepaid voice/text/data plans.&lt;/strong&gt; Usually much less.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:uk&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:uk&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick search will point you to several discussions about the best SIM for whichever country you&amp;rsquo;re headed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;rsquo;ve used Three in both Italy and the UK, Yoigo in Spain, and TrueMove H in Thailand. Italy has been the most expensive so far at €35 for a month, and I think that was mainly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the hell I was doing and bought a more expensive package than I actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to get a SIM is to &lt;strong&gt;go directly to a retail store&lt;/strong&gt; for whichever carrier you choose, then &lt;strong&gt;find the prepaid plan that suits your needs.&lt;/strong&gt; (We&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find brochures in English almost everywhere, as well as people working the counters who are able to speak English well enough to get us set up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of advice: &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t leave the store until you&amp;rsquo;ve verified that you can get online, make a call, and send a text message.&lt;/strong&gt; You probably won&amp;rsquo;t run into any issues, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to find out an hour later that a step was missed — and you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t want to try and explain what&amp;rsquo;s happened to a different employee whose English is about as good as your Italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;having-a-local-number-helps:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Having a Local Number Helps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A benefit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially consider when getting SIM cards is the bonus of having a local number wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Barcelona, we made friends with some locals, and being able to shoot them texts without anyone spending a fortune was very handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In London, calling local businesses to ask if they had something we needed was an enormous time-saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;rsquo;t come up often, but when it does, it&amp;rsquo;s great to know you&amp;rsquo;ve got that covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-data-plans-are-cheap-if-you-re-reasonable:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;The Data Plans Are Cheap — If You&amp;rsquo;re Reasonable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data usage is usually pretty cheap, and the allowances are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, &amp;ldquo;normal usage&amp;rdquo; consists of getting directions and looking up places in Google Maps, checking various social networks once or twice a day, sending a few photos to my friends via MMS, and occasionally asking Google to settle debates.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:debates&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:debates&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re live-streaming everything you do through Periscope, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;staying-connected-to-your-us-based-friends-and-family:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Staying Connected to Your US-Based Friends and Family&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure your loved ones don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay international calling rates to get in touch with you, you can leverage Google and Skype to make sure you can still receive calls — just like you were still in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-a-google-voice-number:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Get a Google Voice Number&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in the US, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html&#34;&gt;Google Voice&lt;/a&gt; is a simple option to give yourself a US-based number that friends can call or text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Google Voice number, you can call or text your friends right from the Gmail app, as well as from the Hangouts app. &lt;strong&gt;Your incoming calls and texts can be forwarded to any US-based phone number&lt;/strong&gt; — I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how to work around this a bit later — or to your email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re also able to set up voicemail with custom greetings, call blocking, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use your computer (or the Hangouts app on wifi) &lt;strong&gt;you can make calls and send texts from your Google Voice number for free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to make sure your family and friends don&amp;rsquo;t have to contact you through an app — my parents, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, greatly appreciate not having to learn what the hell a WhatsApp is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-up-a-skype-number-for-call-forwarding:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Set Up a Skype Number for Call Forwarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work around Google Voice&amp;rsquo;s US-only call-forwarding restriction, &lt;strong&gt;you can get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skype.com/en/features/&#34;&gt;Skype number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for $60/year, which allows you to forward the calls to international numbers in most countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve set up the Skype number, &lt;strong&gt;set your Google Voice number to forward to it.&lt;/strong&gt; Turn off any of Skype&amp;rsquo;s extra features, like voicemail, to make sure that the call goes through to your phone and your Google Voice voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is set up, you just have to remember to set the Skype number to forward to your local number wherever you&amp;rsquo;re staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;staying-connected-is-easier-and-cheaper-than-you-might-think:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e&#34;&gt;Staying Connected Is Easier (and Cheaper) than You Might Think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was concerned before I left that I&amp;rsquo;d have a really difficult and expensive time trying to stay connected abroad. I was concerned I&amp;rsquo;d need to ration my data usage, tell my friends to stop texting me, and pay a fortune to call home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with a little bit of legwork up front, it turns out that &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll actually &lt;em&gt;save a shitload of money&lt;/em&gt; this year over what I was spending to keep a phone through Verizon in the US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the ease of setting it up, and the savings of going prepaid, I&amp;rsquo;m a believer; I&amp;rsquo;ll be a hard sell to ever get a mobile contract again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>Travel Essentials: Understanding How Visas Work</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, travel visas haven&amp;rsquo;t crossed your mind at all as you&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only a month or two out from my flight out of the US — well after I initially booked the ticket — that I realized I needed to worry about visas. Since I&amp;rsquo;d never left the United States for more than a few weeks before, the idea of what travel visas are and why anyone might need a travel visa just hadn&amp;rsquo;t occurred to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article assumes you&amp;rsquo;re in the same boat and have never really given much thought to travel visas. In it, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss &lt;strong&gt;what travel visas are, the methods I&amp;rsquo;m using to travel from country to country on tourist visas, and visa options for travelers who want to stay in a country longer than a few months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-travel-visas:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;What Are Travel Visas?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hugely simplify the concept, a visa is a kind of permission slip from a foreign government to be in the country. An international hall pass, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you can legally enter a foreign country, you need to obtain a visa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, this is easy: when you&amp;rsquo;re getting a tourist visa, for example, an agent from the country your entering will simply ask why you&amp;rsquo;re there — maybe asking a few questions about your reasons for being there and when you&amp;rsquo;re leaving — before stamping your passport with a tourist visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty complicated: to get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/MONTREAL/en/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Documents/Visados%20de%20larga%20duracion/Non-lucrative%20residence%20visa.pdf&#34;&gt;non-lucrative residence visa in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, for example, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to submit a criminal history, doctor&amp;rsquo;s note, your fingerprints, a valid passport, and an application form (and fee) — all verified with something called an apostille.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:apostille&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:apostille&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visas all carry certain restrictions on what you can and cannot do while in the country. They&amp;rsquo;re all valid for a limited period of time, which varies widely depending on the country; some visas are only valid for a month, while others are valid for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to do some research before each trip to make sure you know what kind of visa you&amp;rsquo;ll need to obtain to make sure you stay out of trouble while traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tourist-visas-are-the-way-to-go:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Tourist Visas Are the Way to Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes, tourist visas are the best solution for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not working &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the countries I visit.&lt;/strong&gt; I make all my money from US- and Canadian-based companies, who pay into a US-based bank account. My physical location has no bearing on the work I do.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:prohelp&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:prohelp&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m in Europe or Asia, I&amp;rsquo;m a tourist.&lt;/strong&gt; I take no money out of the economy, but I do put a fair amount into it by paying for short-term rentals, food, and entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like to move every 30–90 days.&lt;/strong&gt; After I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a city for a month or two, I find myself slipping into routines instead of exploring — when I hit this point, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on and rekindle my sense of adventure in a new city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since I rarely want to stay in a country longer than a tourist visa would allow, tourist visas make the most sense for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also wary of staying in any country long enough to give them a reason to expect me to pay taxes there. I&amp;rsquo;m confused enough by trying to pay one federal government — if I can help it, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer not to add another to my todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-all-tourist-visas-are-automatic:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Not All Tourist Visas Are Automatic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries — Thailand and Vietnam, for example — you can&amp;rsquo;t just show up and get a passport stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In order to stay in Thailand for over 30 days, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand/thailand-tourist-visa.php&#34;&gt;apply for a visa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This is really easy, though: just find a Thai embassy in whatever country you&amp;rsquo;re in and fill out the tourist visa form. There&amp;rsquo;s a small fee — about $30 — and you have to leave your passport overnight. When I applied, I was in and out within 30 minutes when I applied and when I picked up the visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to &lt;a href=&#34;http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/consular/visa-application-process&#34;&gt;apply for a visa&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time as well. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done this yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning to head to Vietnam once it starts getting cold in Europe. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the Thai visa: &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not hard, but you have to jump through a few hoops.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll deal with the hassle of figuring out how to get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293921-c148049/Vietnam:Faq.Visa.On.Arrival.Voa.html&#34;&gt;visa-on-arrival arranged&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-aware-of-the-schengen-area:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Be Aware of the Schengen Area&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another surprise to me when I first left was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area&#34;&gt;Schengen Area&lt;/a&gt;, which is a collection of 26 countries in Europe that share one entry visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tourist visa in the Schengen Area is good for 90 days in a 180-day period.&lt;/strong&gt; This means you can only spend 3 of every 6 months in the Schengen Area before you&amp;rsquo;d have to apply for a longer visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to use a tourist visa in Europe, be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sure you&amp;rsquo;re planning to move between countries in a way that won&amp;rsquo;t get you in visa trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had originally thought that I&amp;rsquo;d fly into Italy, stay for a week, head to Spain (new visa), then jump over to France (new visa), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Italy, Spain, and France are all part of the Schengen Area, so after I landed in Italy, I had 90 days to spend there before I needed to head for a country outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Schengen Area makes European travel tricky, but not impossible. The UK and Ireland, for example, are not part of the Schengen Area, so you could spend 90 days in Rome, then head to Dublin for three months before jumping back to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;options-for-staying-longer:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Options for Staying Longer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in staying longer in one place than a tourist visa allows, there are options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since I&amp;rsquo;ve never applied for any long-stay visas, I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the process, cost, or difficulty of obtaining these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some of the methods I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about and share links to articles by people who have actually gone through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;teaching-english-as-a-foreign-language:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Teaching English as a Foreign Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common option for native English speakers who want to live in a foreign country is to teach English as a foreign language (TEFL).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a couple people who are doing this, and it seems to be a great way to go abroad if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable making a reasonably large time commitment for what is generally a pretty low wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a large TEFL community on Reddit, and they&amp;rsquo;ve put together a pretty &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/wiki/gettingstarted/dummiesguide&#34;&gt;comprehensive guide to getting into TEFL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;becoming-a-student:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Becoming a Student&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student visas, obviously, are for students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard rumors of travelers enrolling at &amp;ldquo;schools&amp;rdquo; that are essentially fronts for obtaining student visas semi-legally. That sounds like some shady shit to me, so I never looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not actually a student, this visa probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the best idea. If you are a student, look into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/study-exchange/student.html&#34;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for getting one in the country you want to study in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-options-for-long-term-visas:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Other Options for Long-Term Visas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in attending classes as a teacher or a student, you still have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular long-term visa I keep hearing about is the &lt;strong&gt;non-lucrative residence visa in Spain&lt;/strong&gt;. This visa is for anyone who can prove they can afford to remain in the country for an extended period of time without working — having at least $30,000 in the bank is a good idea, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard. While I don&amp;rsquo;t personally know anyone who&amp;rsquo;s applied for this visa, I did enjoy reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://bucking-the-trend.com/apply-non-lucrative-residence-visa-spain-us-citizen/&#34;&gt;Jed&amp;rsquo;s retelling of the application process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this seems like the right option for you, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/SANFRANCISCO/en/ConsularServices/Documents/visas/NonLucrative.pdf&#34;&gt;here are the guidelines for submitting your application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is the &lt;strong&gt;residence permit for freelance or self-employment in Germany&lt;/strong&gt;. This one requires residence in Germany, so that may be a deal-breaker. If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to live in Germany, however, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/305249/en/&#34;&gt;start the application process&lt;/a&gt;. For a write-up by someone who&amp;rsquo;s gone through the process, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@imcatnoone/how-to-get-your-german-freelance-visa-without-losing-your-sanity-8fa68b39431a&#34;&gt;check out Cat Noone&amp;rsquo;s post on Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re hoping to stay in the Schengen Area for longer than 90 days, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-legally-stay-in-europe-for-more-than-90-days/&#34;&gt;a few loopholes may exist&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like general consensus is that it&amp;rsquo;s just easier to use a tourist visa in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-your-own-research:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d&#34;&gt;Do Your Own Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with anything you read on the internet, your results may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure to verify any information you found in this article&lt;/strong&gt; — and any article that&amp;rsquo;s not directly from a visa-issuing authority in the country you want to visit — before making travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visas aren&amp;rsquo;t hard, but you need to know what you&amp;rsquo;re getting into.&lt;/strong&gt; Read the official government sites to make sure you know the requirements and time limits, then speak to an expert if you&amp;rsquo;re not 100% sure how to get your visas sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t let this intimidate you. I was nervous at first, but having gone through the process I can assure you it&amp;rsquo;s less painful than airport security can be in the US. You&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:apostille&#34;&gt;When I first heard about this, I pictured walking down a drafty, torch-lined hallway toward a heavy iron door, behind which a man — sitting behind a large desk, writing with a quill that he dipped in a bottle of something frighteningly similar in color to blood, his face hidden beneath the hood of a heavy, dark cloak — would rasp at me in a voice dripping with evil, &amp;ldquo;Who dares disturb the apostille?!&amp;rdquo; The truth, unfortunately, is far less interesting. (It&amp;rsquo;s like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention&#34;&gt;super-notarization&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5f56e2b73d91b89eced16bdc0062dd9d:prohelp&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that this lifestyle is currently new enough to fall through cracks in the way countries define work, and this leaves a lot of room for interpretation. I&amp;rsquo;m not an accountant, so you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take my word for any of this. Talk to a professional if you&amp;rsquo;re unsure; &amp;ldquo;Jason told me this would work&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t going to hold up in court.

      <title>How to Tell Your Loved Ones You&#39;re Leaving</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/how-to-tell-your-loved-ones-youre-leaving/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2015 02:07:22 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve made up your mind to spend an extended period of time traveling, and figured out how to make your income location-independent, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to face one of the toughest challenges you&amp;rsquo;re likely to come up against: &lt;strong&gt;figuring out how to tell your family and friends you&amp;rsquo;re leaving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;people-are-resistant-to-things-they-don-t-understand:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;People Are Resistant to Things They Don&amp;rsquo;t Understand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common reaction to things we don&amp;rsquo;t understand is fear. And typically, &lt;strong&gt;fear leads us to assume that the thing that scares us is bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a very good chance that going nomadic is going to be &lt;em&gt;completely fucking foreign&lt;/em&gt; to nearly everyone you know, and reactions will range from the lukewarm&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:lukewarm&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:lukewarm&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to the outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom, who has spent the majority of her life in Montana, worried that I&amp;rsquo;d be kidnapped by terrorists, killed by food poisoning, locked up in a foreign prison for being &amp;ldquo;too American&amp;rdquo; — her list of potential calamities was virtually endless.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:realmom&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:realmom&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really, my mom is excited&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:mom&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:mom&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/how-to-tell-friends-and-family-youre-leaving.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;How to tell friends and family you&amp;amp;#039;re leaving the country.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;educate-whenever-possible:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Educate Whenever Possible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the people we&amp;rsquo;re closest to, most of the objections are coming from a good — albeit misguided — place. They worry we&amp;rsquo;re putting ourselves at risk in some way, and they&amp;rsquo;re trying to caution us against making mistakes that could haunt us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our loved ones will likely make objections based on their fears about world travel and what other countries are like. To combat this, be ready to present evidence that proves their concerns are unfounded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;rsquo;re worried you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to travel, show them how it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/cost-of-living-remotely/&#34;&gt;significantly cheaper to live abroad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they bring up safety, let them know you&amp;rsquo;re about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate&#34;&gt;60% less likely to get murdered&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in Europe or Asia as you are in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if they talk about stability — well, you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly looking for the kind of stability they&amp;rsquo;re pushing on you, so you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to agree to disagree for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remind-them-that-nothing-is-forever:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Remind Them that Nothing Is Forever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because humans are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&#34;&gt;horrible at being rational&lt;/a&gt;, we tend to assume that every decision we make will affect us forever. This, of course, is completely untrue — but we need to remind our family and friends of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m traveling now, and I love it. At the moment I can&amp;rsquo;t see an end to my travels, because my list of places to explore seems to be getting &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I remember a time not that long ago when I believed I&amp;rsquo;d be a touring musician forever. I remember when I told myself I&amp;rsquo;d live in Portland forever.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:portland&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:portland&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in every case, I grew and gained experience, my goals evolved, and I found that what I thought I wanted forever was really just what I wanted for that period in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this period of my life, I want to travel. I fully expect that in the future — whether that&amp;rsquo;s in two weeks or twenty years — I will decide that I&amp;rsquo;m ready to stop traveling and be in once place for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every plan, no matter how permanent it may feel at the time, will evolve over time and — most likely — change entirely as our experience shifts where we place importance in our lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision to travel isn&amp;rsquo;t you saying goodbye to your family and friends forever. It&amp;rsquo;s just you traveling for now, and — if you remind them that nothing is forever — they should support you doing the thing that feels right to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;suggest-get-togethers-in-fun-places:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Suggest Get-Togethers in Fun Places&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t visit my parents often. It&amp;rsquo;s not because I don&amp;rsquo;t love my parents — I do — but rather because my parents live in Whitefish, Montana, which is a small town without much to offer unless you&amp;rsquo;re going fishing, hunting, or skiing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Montana to get away from the snow and the boredom I was dealing with there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to love when my parents would visit me in Portland, though. I always had a list of things to do that was too long for the few days they&amp;rsquo;d be in town, and I&amp;rsquo;d always look forward to their next visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re traveling, you can easily put yourself in locations that are ideal for spending quality time together with loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; If you would usually take a week to hang out with your family each year, why not spend that week on a beach in Costa Rica?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;or-plan-to-visit-home:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Or Plan to Visit Home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to take advantage of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion for your taxes, you have about a month each year to be home, which is actually more time than I usually spend with my family in an average year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those of us who don&amp;rsquo;t live in the same town as our parents, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that we could spend &lt;em&gt;exactly the same amount of time together&lt;/em&gt; each year while traveling the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remember-that-the-world-is-flat:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Remember That the World Is Flat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video calling has changed the world in a way I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully grasp until I was on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps like Google Hangouts, Skype, Facetime, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://talky.io/&#34;&gt;Talky&lt;/a&gt; have created a world where talking to someone face-to-face is easy no matter where in the world you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the odd phone call to friends and family, I usually jump on a video call with someone I care about once a week or so to catch up. As a result, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel disconnected or lonely — it&amp;rsquo;s strikingly similar to the way I used to meet a friend for coffee when we were in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your loved ones won&amp;rsquo;t miss you &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; as much if you set up regular video chats.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have people in your life who struggle technically, sit with them before you leave to show them how the calls work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;give-them-a-little-tough-love:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Give Them a Little Tough Love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes — despite all the pushback from those close to you — you just have to do it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if it&amp;rsquo;s tough, sometime you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to sit someone down and say, &amp;ldquo;I love you, and I know you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but this is what I believe is the best thing for me. I need to see this through.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trust-yourself-to-know-what-s-best-for-you:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8&#34;&gt;Trust Yourself to Know What&amp;rsquo;s Best for You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life boils down to our pursuit of happiness, and very few people will be truly unhappy to see you doing something you love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:unhappy&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5191c1869c72dd371cbec536f4c6bdf8:unhappy&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know that you want to give the digital nomad lifestyle a try, stick to your guns and be willing to defend it to your family and friends. They don&amp;rsquo;t need to understand completely, or even to fully agree with what you&amp;rsquo;re doing — they just need to know you still want them in your lives and that you&amp;rsquo;re not going to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they see how happy you are in your new lifestyle, they&amp;rsquo;ll be hard-pressed not to understand your excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, I&amp;rsquo;m still holding out hope that my dad will be convinced to leave the United States and visit me in Europe next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I can get my dad to entertain the idea of a trans-Atlantic flight to a country where smoked brisket isn&amp;rsquo;t readily available, well&amp;hellip;I believe anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ditch the Day Job: How to Become Location-Independent</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2015 06:32:58 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Becoming location independent clears the way for you to start working from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever considered long-term travel, location-independent income is a non-negotiable part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started, though, can be stressful — and scary as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by telling you how I made the transition out of the traditional workplace and into a role that allows me to make a living no matter where I am in the world. (Hello from Thailand!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterward, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over several options for making a living from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-departure-from-the-9-to-5:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;My Departure from the 9-to-5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early twenties, I moonlighted as a freelance web developer while keeping 9-to-5 jobs ranging from a night auditor at a hotel to a project manager at a Kinko&amp;rsquo;s to a graveyard shift cook at a bowling alley diner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to work for myself, but I had no idea where to start. I only had a few clients, and sometimes I would go a month between jobs. What if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find work? What if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay my rent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last job — working at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s — was a huge help in building my resolve to avoid corporate culture. Kinko&amp;rsquo;s had just been acquired by FedEx, and I watched as all the things that Kinko&amp;rsquo;s used to do for employees that made them love their jobs were systematically stripped away and replaced with more aggressive performance goals and stricter punishments for missing them —all with little or no reward for meeting goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a year I watched FedEx methodically dismantle employee morale. I kept my spirits up by working my off hours on web projects, repeating to myself over and over, &lt;em&gt;This is just for now. Things will get better soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-terrifying-glimmer-of-hope:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;A Terrifying Glimmer of Hope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my chance, it felt like a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/best-friends/&#34;&gt;good friend&lt;/a&gt; had introduced me to a guy named David, who was trying to start a company building simple websites for B-list-or-lower actors and performers. His budget wasn&amp;rsquo;t huge, but he could offer me $1,300/month for three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was spending about $1,050/month on living expenses. If I took David&amp;rsquo;s offer, I&amp;rsquo;d have $250/month to pay my mobile phone bill, buy any necessities, and, y&amp;rsquo;know, &lt;em&gt;eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was only three months of guaranteed income. What if he didn&amp;rsquo;t renew for a fourth month? What if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any income?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-siren-song-of-security:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;The Siren Song of Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same week I started discussing David&amp;rsquo;s project, I got an unexpected offer from a local creative agency. They asked me to come in and interview with them — they&amp;rsquo;d heard of me because of my volunteer work with a local coders&amp;rsquo; meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the interview process, which involved several days&amp;rsquo; worth of meetings with different department heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they told me they were prepared to offer me a job as a web developer and designer. I would more or less be the entirety of their digital department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, we finally got down to heavy details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d want to bring you in at a mid-range salary to show you that we&amp;rsquo;re serious,&amp;rdquo; said the woman who made the hiring decisions. &amp;ldquo;We can offer you $30,000/year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a rush of mixed emotions. On the one hand, $2,500/month was more than I&amp;rsquo;d ever made before, and it would provide me with significantly more spending money than the freelance gig. But on the other hand, $30K was a &lt;em&gt;mid-range&lt;/em&gt; developer salary at this agency? I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was normal, but this felt pretty low to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; I started carefully, &amp;ldquo;so assuming this all goes well and I&amp;rsquo;m a good fit for the team. What&amp;rsquo;s my growth potential here? Would I be able to see an increase in that salary after proving I&amp;rsquo;m able to handle the workload here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She shifted uncomfortably. &amp;ldquo;Well, yes. I would say you have the potential to make up to $35,000 a year here, assuming everything goes well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt my heart sink. I had a vision of software development at an ad agency as a glamorous job, full of challenging work and long hours, but with high pay to make it all worth it. But this job was offering me less than my manager at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s made in a year, with virtually no growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little voice&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; nagged at me that this was &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a steady paycheck&lt;/em&gt;. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-by-on-ramen-noodles-and-hope:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Getting By on Ramen Noodles and Hope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep much the next few days. I kept rolling around my options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical part of me was convinced. &lt;em&gt;Take the agency job. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of money, but it&amp;rsquo;s experience that you can use to trade up in a couple years. And it&amp;rsquo;s not like you&amp;rsquo;re taking a pay cut to move into a job you like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my gut didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re only considering this agency job because you&amp;rsquo;re a chickenshit,&lt;/em&gt; it hissed at me. &lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been telling everyone you know that you just need a chance to be self-employed, and now you have that chance. So are you going to take it? Or are you a liar and a coward?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was right, I realized. I had been looking for this chance for over a year, and now it was in my hands. If I turned it down, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure how long it would take to get another chance like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the agency and declined, citing my concerns about growth potential. They seemed miffed, but it also sounded like they were already expecting me to turn it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called David and accepted the contract. He told me he&amp;rsquo;d drop the check in the mail that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put in my two weeks&amp;rsquo; notice at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I bought a pallet of ramen noodles, sat down on my couch, and hyperventilated for the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-payoff:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;The Payoff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Kinko&amp;rsquo;s, a funny thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leads I&amp;rsquo;d been talking to for months without any movement were suddenly ready to pull the trigger. I started getting new leads around town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost like people could smell that I&amp;rsquo;d started taking web development seriously. I was no longer doing web design on the side; &lt;em&gt;I was a web developer, full stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between receiving David&amp;rsquo;s first check and the end of our contract (five months later), I had built up enough business to be bringing in an average of $3,000/month. If I could keep this up, I&amp;rsquo;d make $36,000 or so for the year — more than the agency would have paid assuming they found me especially good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was terrified to leave the security of my day job. I was convinced that I had no hope of making a decent living on my own. I was sure that the concerns of my parents, past employers, teachers — basically every adult I&amp;rsquo;d ever met — were correct and that the only way to really make it was to get a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job: the kind with health insurance and paid vacation and annual reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my instincts said there was a better way. And I took a leap of faith, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/&#34;&gt;set myself on fire&lt;/a&gt;, and trusted myself to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my life has never been the same since. I&amp;rsquo;m happier now, more confident in myself, less bothered by the unknown — every part of my life improved as a direct result of taking charge of my life and becoming self-employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-options-exist-for-remote-work:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;What Options Exist for Remote Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for making a living without having to be physically present in a particular place. Three of the most common (and versatile) options are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a passive income stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convince your boss to let you work remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from anywhere as a freelancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-passive-income:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Create Passive Income&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive income is the most alluring form of making money remotely. After all, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to make money while they sleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal experience with passive income has been generating it for other people; my own passive revenue streams are limited to affiliate sales on Amazon, book royalties, and whatever my investments earn — in short, it&amp;rsquo;s a very small part of my overall income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I won&amp;rsquo;t talk too much about generating passive income. There are other people more qualified to cover the subject — check out Chris Guillebeau&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307951529/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307951529&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jl1985-20&amp;amp;linkId=MDOK4KJXNHWBOYVV&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;$100 Startup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-products:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Digital Products&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful passive revenue stream I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to reproduce for my clients has been digital products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my friend and client &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theptdc.com/who-we-are/jonathan-goodman-2/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Goodman&lt;/a&gt; runs a business from all over the world that sells digital products helping personal trainers become better at personal training, selling their services, and establishing additional revenue streams like online coaching. He has a small handful of products — most of which he created, built a marketing funnel for, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t had to touch (much) since — that earn him a comfortable living without a lot of weekly effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-services:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Online Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another friend and client, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnromaniello.com/&#34;&gt;John &amp;ldquo;Roman&amp;rdquo; Romaniello&lt;/a&gt;, has built passive income by creating companies that he more or less only provides ideas for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roman&amp;rsquo;s created an online client management platform that he uses for his own online clients, but that he also sells to other coaches on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has a development team to keep it afloat, a management and marketing team to keep it running smoothly, and various other people on his team to take care of the day-to-day operation of the company — his only real job at the company is to give direction for what the team should focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;passive-is-kind-of-a-misnomer:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Passive&amp;rdquo; Is Kind of a Misnomer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important, though, to note that while Jon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to put a lot of effort into building the products themselves, and Roman doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to deal with much of the daily operations of his coaching platform, both of these guys spend &lt;em&gt;a lot of time&lt;/em&gt; working on creating content and staying active on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive income is very rarely &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; passive, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-a-full-time-job-that-lets-you-work-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Find a Full-Time Job That Lets You Work Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is a little bit like having your cake and eating it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find full-time employment that&amp;rsquo;s entirely remote, you&amp;rsquo;ve effectively managed to hold on to the security of a 9-to-5 job while also gaining the freedom of working from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hunt-for-remote-jobs:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Hunt for Remote Jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, being a remote worker is no longer uncommon. Many notable companies, including Automattic (the company that built WordPress), Basecamp, and Buffer are almost entirely remote, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics&#34;&gt;reports claim&lt;/a&gt; that 3.3 million full-time employees in the US workforce were able to telecommute at least part of the time as of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone looking to start a new career, or move to a new job, there are a large number of job boards that specialize exclusively in listing remote jobs, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://remoteok.io/&#34;&gt;remoteok.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jobs.remotive.io/&#34;&gt;jobs.remotive.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://weworkremotely.com/&#34;&gt;weworkremotely.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wfh.io/&#34;&gt;WFH.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other options — if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for remote work, you won&amp;rsquo;t have too much trouble finding companies willing to hire you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;convince-your-boss-to-let-you-work-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little more challenging, but if you feel confident that you can do your existing job without going into the office, it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying to convince your boss that it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a strong case for why the company would be better off with you telecommuting, and build trust in your ability to work from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For an in-depth strategy, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/convince-your-boss-remote-work/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;freelance-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Freelance Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously the simplest and most difficult way to make a living remotely, freelancing is one of the most common approaches taken by digital nomads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the riskiest prospect because there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee of work, but with a little care and a lot of effort, you can build a strong referral network to keep your sales funnel full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-yourself-as-an-expert:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Position Yourself as an Expert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find things that you&amp;rsquo;re very good at and interested in — the things you get excited talking about — and start teaching them: speak at local meetups, submit conference talk proposals, write tutorials, and do anything you can to publicly stake a claim that you &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; whatever arena you want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes you appear to be an authority, and people looking for freelancers want to hire the best available help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, &lt;strong&gt;nothing will force you to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know your shit like trying to teach it to someone else.&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t gloss over details when you&amp;rsquo;re explaining it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-damn-sure-you-get-a-good-referral:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Make Damn Sure You Get a Good Referral&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working remotely, you may not get the chance to go out and meet your clients — especially in more remote locations — so you need to make sure that other people are doing your sales for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get a client, become their hero. They&amp;rsquo;ve come to you to solve a problem, so solve that problem completely, and make sure they know what&amp;rsquo;s going on at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can A) solve your clients&amp;rsquo; problems for them, and B) make sure they never felt like you had disappeared&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; during the project, you&amp;rsquo;re almost ensured a good referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each successful project, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to ask your client to either send you a testimonial (you can use this for marketing, too) or ask them to complete a survey about your performance — in either case, they finish the project by reminding themselves all the things they liked about working with you. Later, when a friend mentions a problem that you can solve, your client will be eager to drop your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remove-the-anchor-of-office-bound-work:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Remove the Anchor of Office-Bound Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing the anchor of reporting to an office every day is an astonishingly liberating accomplishment, whether your goal is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/&#34;&gt;sell everything and travel the world&lt;/a&gt;, or simply to cut your commute and eliminate the requirement to wear pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also daunting, and it requires some legwork to make it happen. But don&amp;rsquo;t give up — I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to meet &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who made the transition to remote work and regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;This voice sounded alarmingly similar to my mother&amp;rsquo;s.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;#protip: The window of time between your last communication and when the client will wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is much shorter than you think. Daily communication is ideal — you don&amp;rsquo;t need to deliver something every day, but make sure they know you&amp;rsquo;re working on their project.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of benefits to being an employee. Things like health care, paid vacation, and — of course — a steady paycheck are nothing to scoff at. But if you&amp;rsquo;re sick of being stuck in an office, how can you convince your boss to let you work remotely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re ready to take off and see the world, looking to cut down on your commute, or if you&amp;rsquo;d just like to have extra time with your loved ones, telecommuting is the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the business world seems to be coming around to telecommuting, you may still be facing an uphill battle to convince your boss to let you cut the cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you convince your boss to let you work from home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/how-to-convince-your-boss-remote-work.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;how to convince your boss to let your work from home&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-out-the-logistics-ahead-of-time:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Work Out the Logistics Ahead of Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your boss to take your proposal seriously, make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got all the details worked out before you bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your office has anything special in place — a VPN, for example — figure out how you can connect to it from home. Be ready to explain, in vivid detail, all the ways you&amp;rsquo;ll be overcoming hurdles between you and your goal of working from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arm-yourself-with-research:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Arm Yourself with Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re ready to back up your claims with actual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to have any trouble finding research to support your claims. There&amp;rsquo;s a growing mountain of research papers proving that employees &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; employers benefit from remote working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look for it, you&amp;rsquo;ll find data proving that remote workers are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794&#34;&gt;less likely to quit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home&#34;&gt;more productive&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sqwiggle.com/working-remotely-saves-money/&#34;&gt;less expensive for the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg; for a more in-depth look, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-everyone-wins/&#34;&gt;how remote work is a win for everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-the-benefits-to-the-company:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Focus on the Benefits to the Company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in your boss&amp;rsquo;s shoes: if someone walked into your office and started talking about this thing they want you to let them do that will make their lives super awesome but that makes no difference for you, what&amp;rsquo;s your initial reaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be nonplussed about the whole idea. Why should you bother putting the effort into changing this arrangement if it only benefits one person? There are surely other projects you could work on that would benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, you might be inclined to turn down the idea because it sounds awesome and you want it, but you can&amp;rsquo;t have it, so no one should have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you bring the idea to your boss, compare these two statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: How Working Remotely Benefits You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you let me work from home, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to spend more time with my family and friends, avoid the commute, and have fewer distractions when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get stuff done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: How Working Remotely Benefits Your Boss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I work from home, you&amp;rsquo;ll be saving the company over $10,000 each year, studies have shown a 13.5% boost in remote productivity over office-based productivity, and remote workers are also more likely to take ownership of their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re the boss, which one sounds like a better call for the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you&amp;rsquo;re not the boss, you&amp;rsquo;re asking for exactly the same outcome with both statements; one just makes you sound selfish, and one makes you sound like a team player looking out for the company&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-small-with-trial-runs:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Start Small with Trial Runs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never worked remotely before, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to propose that you just&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t come in anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, propose something small, like one day per week to work remotely. It should go without saying that your teleworking day needs to be your most productive for the week to prove the point that this is better for everyone. (To give yourself a running start on your remote days, make sure you have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/effective-project-planning/&#34;&gt;clear plan&lt;/a&gt; for what you&amp;rsquo;re going to work on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve established that you&amp;rsquo;re reliable as a remote worker, attempt to up the number of days out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to prove that you&amp;rsquo;re better when you&amp;rsquo;re not in the office, and that nothing went wrong without your physical presence. You can use the evidence to support your case to go fully remote — it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to make the case if you&amp;rsquo;ve got metrics, so use something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com/&#34;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of how your time was spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-forgiveness-not-permission:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company isn&amp;rsquo;t receptive to a trial period, you can always adopt a different tactic and drag them, kicking and screaming, to victory.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call in sick on a weekday — probably not a Monday or Friday so you don&amp;rsquo;t look like you&amp;rsquo;re trying to squeeze out a long weekend — and just work remotely. Get your tasks done, keep in touch with your team, and handle the day like you would if it was a normal, remote working day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a note of how much more productive the day was. If you can prove it, prove it. If not, make sure your boss is included on the task completion notices so they can see that you cranked things out from home — even while &amp;ldquo;sick&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad used this technique to build up to the point where he was only coming into the office a couple times a month. After a while, he would take his phone as a mobile hotspot out on his boat and work while fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His boss was none the wiser — after several months of working from his favorite fishing hole, his boss finally asked him to come into the office. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of a lake right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than getting in trouble for surreptitiously working from wherever he felt like for months, my dad was able to remove all ties from his office because they realized that, really, he&amp;rsquo;d already done it without their knowledge. They never had a clue because he never faltered in his productivity or responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;don-t-give-up:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Give Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a traditional 9-to-5 role, convincing your boss to let you leave the office is going to be an uphill battle in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that big changes take time, and often times the resistance to an idea isn&amp;rsquo;t due to someone disagreeing with you; it&amp;rsquo;s just too new and uncomfortable, and they need some time to chew on it before they can consider it objectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to convince your boss to let you work remotely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all your ducks in a row and be ready to overcome any logistical objections about your ability to get the job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be ready to present research to back up all your claims that remote work is a win for the company as much as it is for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the ways that remote work will benefit your boss; people are much more motivated by self-interest, and bosses want to look good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t go for full independence right out of the gate. Instead, start with trial runs to prove that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to work with your boss to prove this is good for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t convince your boss, you can try to just do it anyways and ask for forgiveness instead of permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, if all else fails, you can look at other &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/&#34;&gt;ways of becoming location independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;This technique is not for the faint of heart. You need to be willing to 100% own this decision — if you falter, or seem anything less than unwaveringly convinced that you&amp;rsquo;re in the right, this technique could end up harming your career. Use at your own risk.

      <title>The Best Way to Save Money: World Travel</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you needed to cut your expenses by, say, about a thousand dollars each year, how would you go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people start by cutting back on going out to eat, avoiding online shopping, or creating a stringent budget to control expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a much easier way to cut your expenses by 10% or more: &lt;em&gt;start traveling the world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/save-money-world-travel.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;save money by traveling the world&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-living-abroad-is-cheaper-than-a-lease:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6&#34;&gt;How Living Abroad Is Cheaper than a Lease&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to live abroad, let&amp;rsquo;s do some quick math.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:math&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:math&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by making a list of all the bills you pay that are related to your living arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, when I lived in Missoula, Montana — which has a pretty low cost of living — my bills looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent: $675&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electric: $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas/Water/Sewer: $35&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV/Internet: $125&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renter&amp;rsquo;s Insurance: $25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biweekly Cleaning Service: $160&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cleaning&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cleaning&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all things included, &lt;strong&gt;I spent $1,120/month to live there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-secret-of-the-shared-economy:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6&#34;&gt;The Secret of the Shared Economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you decide to leave your lease behind and start traveling permanently, something magical happens: &lt;strong&gt;all the extra bills go away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/prague-airbnb.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;cheap Prague rental on Airbnb&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4500253&#34;&gt;apartment in Prague&lt;/a&gt; costs less than $700/month — wifi and utilities included.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you search for an apartment in Prague for a month on Airbnb, there are more than 300 results under $1,120/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But wait,&amp;rdquo; you say, &amp;ldquo;your rent was only $675 before — isn&amp;rsquo;t that &lt;em&gt;way more expensive&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cheaper,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cheaper&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cheaper&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you rent a place through the shared economy, all of the additional costs are included.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting an apartment in Prague for $900/month &lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt; electricity, internet, utilities, and sometimes even a regular cleaning.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:airbnbcleaning&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:airbnbcleaning&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that $900/month means $900/month. Not $900 plus a bunch of extra living costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-i-want-to-stay-in-manhattan:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6&#34;&gt;What If I Want to Stay in Manhattan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some places are extremely expensive to live. If you want to spend a while in Manhattan, London, Sydney, or other cities with a high cost of living, it can be challenging to find something lower than $1,120/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: &lt;strong&gt;it can still be less expensive than your lease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-advantage-of-averages:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6&#34;&gt;Taking Advantage of Averages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, let&amp;rsquo;s assume the place in London costs $2,000/month. You&amp;rsquo;re out of pocket an additional $850 for the month over what you would have spent in your lease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make this affordable, though: &lt;strong&gt;take advantage of less expensive places to offset costs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can spend as little as $300/month for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nomadlist.com/chiang-mai-thailand&#34;&gt;place to live in Chiang Mai, Thailand&lt;/a&gt; — this is a place with wifi, air conditioning, and all the amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to spend half your year in low-cost cities like Chiang Mai and Prague, and the other half in more expensive cities, you might schedule something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January and February in London.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:london&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:london&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March through May in Prague.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June and July in Chiang Mai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August and September in Barcelona.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October in Paris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November and December in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skyscanner.com/&#34;&gt;Skyscanner&lt;/a&gt; to determine the cost of flights, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; to determine the average cost of renting a place for a month, this comes out to an average $1,040/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/lease-vs-airbnb-cost-of-living.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;save about $1,000 by traveling the world&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Over the course of a year, living expenses end up lower when traveling.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a savings of about $1,000 for the year when compared to my costs in Missoula.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:sf&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:sf&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s not just a $1,000 savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re saving $1,000 by traveling to 6 countries instead of staying in Missoula, Montana.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:mt&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:mt&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-save-tons-of-money-by-traveling-the-world:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6&#34;&gt;You Can Save Tons of Money by Traveling the World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds completely counterintuitive, but it&amp;rsquo;s true: you can save a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of money by giving up your lease and renting apartments from sites like Airbnb around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap: once you&amp;rsquo;ve factored in the rest of the costs of living there, &lt;strong&gt;a $675/month lease in Montana is more expensive than renting apartments around the world for a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the result of a complex scheme to save money. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t even require making sacrifices. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living quite comfortably in Chiang Mai for a month, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent less than a thousand dollars &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; since I&amp;rsquo;ve been here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So remember: the next time you need to save up for a big expense, consider the traveling the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.

  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cleaning&#34;&gt;I hate cleaning toilets and scrubbing floors, so I build the cost of a biweekly cleaning into my rent.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:cheaper&#34;&gt;Also worth noting are the more than 20 listings under $675/month.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:airbnbcleaning&#34;&gt;If the cleaning isn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly covered, you can usually negotiate a small additional fee to add that in before you finalize the stay.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:london&#34;&gt;Actually, don&amp;rsquo;t go to London in January unless you like being cold and damp.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7722f81d013601de62233bbeba3f06e6:sf&#34;&gt;The numbers get crazier: someone living in San Francisco, where the median rent is about $3,000, would save about $28,800 each year by traveling the world. That&amp;rsquo;s fucking nuts.

&lt;p&gt;The traditional office setting has its perks: community, an environment set up for productivity, common meeting spaces for face-to-face interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with global access to reliable video meeting services and a host of other cloud-based team management tools, remote workers have access to the same perks, plus a host of other bonuses: fewer distractions, less micromanagement, little or no commute, and — most importantly — location independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a one-sided victory, either: businesses hiring remote workers also see lower costs, lower turnover, happier employees, and a worldwide talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-your-team-can-work-from-anywhere-you-can-hire-from-anywhere:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;When Your Team Can Work from Anywhere, You Can Hire from Anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team works remotely, &lt;em&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be in the city where your company is based.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-hire-remote-team/&#34;&gt;hire the right person&lt;/a&gt; for the job, no matter where they are in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means a developer living in Iowa doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to drop everything and move to San Francisco or Brooklyn to have a shot at getting a cool startup job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means an entrepreneur in Mississippi can hire top talent from anywhere in the world without having to convince anyone to move to Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a remote team, the workforce expands from whatever the population of your home town is to approximately &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/30/global-population/&#34;&gt;4.8 billion working-age people&lt;/a&gt; who may be able to meet a need for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-workers-are-results-based-by-default:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Workers Are Results-Based by Default&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to make sure employees and contractors feel empowered is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/results-based-work/&#34;&gt;switch to a results-based approach&lt;/a&gt; where employees are rewarded for efficiency instead of just showing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving to a results-based environment is a huge win for any company (and its employees), and adopting a telecommuting culture is a great way to kickstart the process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-workers-are-more-productive:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Workers Are More Productive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study performed at a call center, &lt;strong&gt;employees allowed to work from home were &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf&#34;&gt;13.5% more productive&lt;/a&gt; than those working in the call center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a psychological benefit to this as well: reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we grant an employee the freedom to work on their own schedule, it&amp;rsquo;s a display of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/724ecialdiniwiki/chapter-1-weapons-of-influence/chapter-2-reciprocation&#34;&gt;hard-wired to reciprocate&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;put your trust in someone and their default response will be to reciprocate by doing good work&lt;/strong&gt; — repaying your trust, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-work-lowers-turnover:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Work Lowers Turnover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gorowe.com/main/what-is-rowe&#34;&gt;Results-Only Work Environment&lt;/a&gt; (ROWE), &lt;strong&gt;Best Buy saw an astonishing 45% reduction in turnover:&lt;/strong&gt; nearly half the people who would have quit &lt;em&gt;stayed with the company&lt;/em&gt; because they were happier with the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important, because the &lt;a href=&#34;http://guides.wsj.com/management/recruiting-hiring-and-firing/how-to-reduce-employee-turnover/&#34;&gt;cost of turnover adds up fast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs upwards of twice an employee’s salary to find and train a replacement. And churn can damage morale among remaining employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://guides.wsj.com/management/recruiting-hiring-and-firing/how-to-reduce-employee-turnover/&#34;&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-work-empowers-employees:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Work Empowers Employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/i-love-my-job.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;make the job something workers love&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Employees who feel in control of their work lives love their jobs.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;rsquo;re not being micromanaged, we&amp;rsquo;re able to self-direct and take ownership of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be understated, because employee ownership likely plays a huge role in the reduced turnover ROWE reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an employer, the Holy Grail of creating a healthy culture is &lt;a href=&#34;http://creatingtheconversation.com/employee-engagment-can-make-or-break-your-company/&#34;&gt;employee engagement&lt;/a&gt; — this is a buzzword that, at its core, describes employees who feel personally responsible for the success or failure of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letting employees go remote forces them to own their tasks in order to perform well. This gives them a sense of &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-005X.2012.00284.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&#34;&gt;autonomy and reduced pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal responsibility leads to an emotional investment in the success or failure of projects — and like magic, your company has better employee engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just keeping butts in chairs, you build a family of employees who care about the company&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-work-lowers-costs:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Work Lowers Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a startup in San Francisco, getting office space for 10 employees will &lt;a href=&#34;http://priceonomics.com/how-much-do-startups-pay-for-office-space/&#34;&gt;cost about $6,000/month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine putting that money back into the operating fund. Even if you buy all 10 remote workers a &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1D00fzK&#34;&gt;Herman Miller office chair&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;d still &lt;strong&gt;save about $57K over the course of a year by letting them work remotely&lt;/strong&gt; and push that chair up to their desk at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, remote workers are far less likely to call in sick: there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/pros-cons&#34;&gt;63% fewer unscheduled absences&lt;/a&gt; for telecommuters over in-office workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. There are quite a few arguments that suggest &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sqwiggle.com/working-remotely-saves-money/&#34;&gt;remote working saves money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/remote-work-trust-your-team.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;the only real argument against remote work is &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t trust my team&amp;#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  All the other arguments are (scientifically) invalid.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-working-just-makes-sense:245543e390042b6cbc7238076d84cc01&#34;&gt;Remote Working Just Makes Sense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the research, remote workers are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753502000425&#34;&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home&#34;&gt;more productive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794&#34;&gt;less likely to quit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sqwiggle.com/working-remotely-saves-money/&#34;&gt;less expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samfak.umu.se/english/about-the-faculty/news/newsdetailpage/long-distance-commuters-get-divorced-more-often.cid160978&#34;&gt;less likely to get divorced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the hell isn&amp;rsquo;t everyone already doing this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>What I Found by Getting Lost: The Best Way to Discover a City</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/discover-a-new-city</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Marisa and I lived for a month in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were in Poble Sec, a cozy neighborhood full of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincho&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pintxos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and tiny bars. The location couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been better; almost everything we wanted to see in the city was less than 40 minutes away walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first weekend in town, we rode the Metro to Sagrada Familia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we emerged out of the underground, we were immediately swallowed by the tide of slow-moving tourists. We drifted with the ambling, skyward-gazing current, rising in waves to snap iPhone photos&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:tourists&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:tourists&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before breaking against the outdoor seating of gelato shops charging €5 for a bottle of water. In the center, a towering island, the church stood over us in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD&#34;&gt;Antoni Gaudí&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; signature sorta-melted-insect-hive style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no bearings. The only way out was to duck back into the Metro and flee to the Poble Sec stop in search of familiar ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;fb-post&#34; data-href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/jlengstorf/photos/a.762037993866104.1073741829.107496345986942/763332393736664/?type=1&#34; data-width=&#34;565&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;fb-xfbml-parse-ignore&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/jlengstorf/photos/a.762037993866104.1073741829.107496345986942/763332393736664/?type=1&#34;&gt;Photo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/jlengstorf&#34;&gt;Jason Lengstorf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, our friend Humberto from &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/malamenbcn/&#34;&gt;Malamén&lt;/a&gt;, a bar near where we were staying, invited us to join him for tacos at a restaurant called La Taqueria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/la-taqueria-barcelona.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Barcelona tacos — discover a new city the best way&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Really good tacos. Try the nopales.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we knew we were going to eat a heavy meal, we wanted to walk to the restaurant. It was about 35 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked, we spotted businesses along the way that looked cool, so we noted them for later. There was interesting graffiti everywhere. We caught single-sentence snippets of other people&amp;rsquo;s lives, and wondered at the staggering number of dogs wearing capes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, rounding a corner — a block away from La Taqueria — Sagrada Familia loomed overhead. It was no longer an island. I knew exactly where I was. I knew that a block behind this Holiest Hive in Europe and its swarm of sightseers, there was a whole city full of real places, and real humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And, it turns out, pretty damn good tacos.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-found-by-getting-lost:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;What I Found by Getting Lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first week or two, Barcelona seemed like a maze. Much of it was built before grid-based cities existed, so the streets dart off at odd angles, careening through dark alleys and opening suddenly into gorgeous hidden plazas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly because we kept getting lost, we almost never walked the same route when we left Poble Sec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignleft&#34;&gt;

  Marisa sipping chai at Cometa, a café we found while lost.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://lamarmotacafe.com/&#34;&gt;La Marmota&lt;/a&gt;, which became a regular breakfast haunt&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:marmota&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:marmota&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, while attempting to locate a vermouth bar&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:vermouth&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:vermouth&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.culinarybackstreets.com/barcelona/2014/morro-fi-mitja-vida/&#34;&gt;Morro Fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my quest to find a decent cocktail&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:cocktail&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:cocktail&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we ended up finding several great art installations and a hot dog shop that was &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for a late night snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;d taken the Metro, or a cab, or even walked the same route every time, we would have missed these places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barcelona is packed full of hidden treasures that won&amp;rsquo;t make top ten lists. Tiny cafés with friendly people and local art are on almost every block. Side streets hide gorgeous architecture and interesting shops. Your favorite new spot might be just around that corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;rsquo;ll never find these places if you don&amp;rsquo;t get lost every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;don-t-just-visit-a-city-explore-it:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Just Visit a City; Explore It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things that make discovering a new city easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-walk-unless-it-s-absolutely-necessary-not-to:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;1. Walk unless it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely necessary not to.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can walk about three miles (4.8 kilometers) in an hour — if you&amp;rsquo;re staying in the heart of a city, that means you can cover an awful lot of ground on foot.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:walking&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:walking&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-don-t-visit-the-same-places-more-than-once-or-twice-a-week:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;2. Don&amp;rsquo;t visit the same places more than once or twice a week.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force yourself to try new places. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to have a favorite hangout — I always have a go-to coffee shop, bar, and restaurant for days when I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood for familiar and easy — but avoid falling into the trap of treating the first place you like as your only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to shop, figure out which neighborhoods have shops and hit them all.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:shops&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:shops&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t just do laps on the same streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve figured out where everything is in your neighborhood, start hitting the next neighborhood over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out and explore. Wander. Get lost and see what&amp;rsquo;s out there to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-figure-out-where-the-locals-go:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;3. Figure out where the locals go.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask the people you meet where they go for food and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always try to get a feel for what someone is into, and ask questions relevant to their interests: in a restaurant you love, ask the waiter where else you should eat; at a good bar, ask where the best cocktails are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People love to share the things they know, and if you ask someone who&amp;rsquo;s passionate about a subject, you&amp;rsquo;ll get &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g187497-Barcelona_Catalonia-Vacations.html&#34;&gt;better information than TripAdvisor&lt;/a&gt; can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-take-a-different-route-every-time:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;4. Take a different route every time.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole new world might open up just a block over from where you walked last time. If you walk down 4th Street to get somewhere, head over to 5th on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what you&amp;rsquo;ll come across?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, you still got home, and now you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to bother with that road again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4th, though, you&amp;rsquo;ll just find the same places you found on the way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did my standard searches for things to do in Barcelona, I kept hitting lists with the same things: go to Sagrada Familia; eat at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.bcn50.org/&#34;&gt;Adriá Brothers&amp;rsquo; restaurants&lt;/a&gt;; check out the beach; walk along Las Ramblas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Pakta is definitely worth the hype.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: all of those things were great, but Barcelona — and every city I&amp;rsquo;ve ever visited, for that matter — is &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than a list of &amp;ldquo;10 Must-See Places&amp;rdquo; or a top 5 restaurant guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-worn paths are safe and easy, but they also carry with them a high risk of living in the Travel Bubble. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the best way to discover a city, going where other tourists go just isn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travel because there&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of world out there to see and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to &lt;em&gt;actually experience&lt;/em&gt; the city you&amp;rsquo;re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-explore:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323&#34;&gt;How Do You Explore?&lt;/h2&gt;

  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:tourists&#34;&gt;I make fun of tourists with full knowledge that — from time to time — I&amp;rsquo;m the worst kind of tourist. &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/jlengstorf/&#34;&gt;My Instagram feed&lt;/a&gt; is a shameful display of food photos and skylines.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:tourists&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:marmota&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found ourselves ordering &lt;em&gt;café con leche&lt;/em&gt; in La Marmota on February 2nd, and one of the owners — having learned that my Spanish was more or less restricted to food-related discussions — asked, &amp;ldquo;Do you have the holiday in the United States?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of miming and a debate between Marisa and I over what the hell a marmot is, we realized that we were talking about Groundhog Day&amp;hellip;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0140952/quotes&#34;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:marmota&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:vermouth&#34;&gt;In Barcelona, a bodega is a particular brand of bar that serves snacks and lighter drinks, like vermouth. Y&amp;rsquo;know, &lt;em&gt;Afternoon Drinks.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:vermouth&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

For delicious (but expensive) fancypants cocktails, make a reservation at Mutis — if you can figure out how to get a reservation (we got ours because David at Malamén used to work there and made a call on our behalf).
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:cocktail&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:walking&#34;&gt;According to my phone, I&amp;rsquo;ve averaged about three and a quarter miles of walking every day. On some days I&amp;rsquo;ve walked as many as 8 miles, and on others I&amp;rsquo;ve barely walked to the coffee shop and back. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also only been on a train or in a cab (other than going to and from the airport) three times since leaving the United States — I feel pretty confident that my comfort in Barcelona was entirely due to the fact I was actually &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the city and not just popping in and out of transit stops.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:walking&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5af11e642d01d01a9e3301a08792c323:shops&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite understood the idea of traveling to shop; from what I can tell, the shops are all the same international brands. So unless you live somewhere that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have those shops, it seems a little silly to weigh yourself down with stuff you could just buy at home. But, hey — I&amp;rsquo;m not judging. Do your thing.

      <title>Speechless: Key Phrases to Learn in a Foreign Language</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/foreign-language-phrases</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I started out feeling pretty cocky. I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I speak a little Spanish. How hard could Italian really be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airport was easy; everyone spoke English. The train, too. Our taxi driver didn&amp;rsquo;t speak much English, but all he really needed was an address, anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was promising: three interactions with Italians and no issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cab driver dropped us at Ripa&amp;rsquo;s Cafe, where our Airbnb host, Francesco, had left the keys to his apartment. I felt bulletproof as I wheeled my carry-on into the bar and approached the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prego?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; The man behind the counter was in a hurry, and folks from the neighborhood were queueing up behind me for lottery tickets and cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth, froze, and slowly closed it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck. I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to say &amp;ldquo;keys&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tongue-tied. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know how to tell this poor guy I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian. My cocksure attitude toward the language barrier withered, and I knew I was defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so — my cheeks burning bright red in embarrassment — I waved the white flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;English?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head and walked away. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if he was coming back. Were we supposed to wait?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the people behind me staring daggers into the back of my head. My body was tying itself in knots. I was shrinking in shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can help, please?&amp;rdquo; A girl had appeared behind the counter, looking at Marisa and I with pity. She barely spoke any English, but with a lot of miming and hand gestures we were able to get the keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we finally found the apartment, I felt sick and helpless as I collapsed on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; over my head,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/Mime.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;mime&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  For how communicationally challenged I felt, I may as well have been wearing face paint.

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://mime.com.ua/&#34;&gt;Никита Капранов&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I came to grips with the fact I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to learn Italian by magic and/or wishing &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard, I did two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duolingo.com/&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; and started the Spanish course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a list of phrases that I knew I would use multiple times each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had to figure out how to get by without speaking the language.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to acknowledge people when spoken to. I was going to need to ask for things like food and coffee. I knew people would help me, and I needed to know how thank them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My emergency phrase list was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no avoiding it, really; I&amp;rsquo;m a terrible mime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-enough-to-get-by:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Know Enough to Get By&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a short trip — for instance, five days in Milan — there&amp;rsquo;s very little chance I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; learn the language. So instead, I choose to &lt;strong&gt;focus on the words and phrases that meet the minimum requirements for functioning in that country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, these are the phrases I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the most mileage out of. You won&amp;rsquo;t impress the locals with your conversational skills. You&amp;rsquo;ll still be lost in most conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But knowing these few key phrases will at least give you tools to feel a little less helpless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-learn-how-to-apologize:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Step 1: Learn How to Apologize&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/im-sorry.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;I&amp;#39;m sorry&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not get much done, but if you learn &lt;em&gt;nothing else&lt;/em&gt; of a foreign language, at least &lt;strong&gt;learn how to apologize for showing up in someone else&amp;rsquo;s country and not speaking their language.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s usually just two phrases: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;excuse me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-m-sorry-i-don-t-speak-your-language:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Sorry, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Speak Your Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the debacle in Milan, this is the first phrase I will learn in every language. I&amp;rsquo;ll know it before I enter the country, and I&amp;rsquo;ll have practiced it under my breath repeatedly as I deplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly useful in the practical sense. It won&amp;rsquo;t help anyone understand what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say. In fact, after I&amp;rsquo;ve said it, I&amp;rsquo;ll be exactly where I was before I said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one key difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; key difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve let the person I&amp;rsquo;m speaking to know that — if nothing else — &lt;strong&gt;I cared enough to learn how to let them know I&amp;rsquo;m a dumbshit tourist who can&amp;rsquo;t speak their language.&lt;/strong&gt; I put in a tiny bit of effort to show respect, even if it won&amp;rsquo;t help us communicate any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, after trying this in both Italy and Spain so far, is that it totally transforms my interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said nothing and gaped helplessly at the waitress, the situation was a stand-off: an exasperated waitress stares into my wide, uncomprehending eyes with a look of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making the effort and letting her know I don&amp;rsquo;t understand her, it becomes a relatively painless situation: she smiles and says something I don&amp;rsquo;t understand,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:waitress&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:waitress&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; then calls to the back for the dishwasher, who speaks English, and we&amp;rsquo;re able to place our order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my goal is to learn how to order in the local language as quickly as possible to avoid the need for a translator altogether. In the time before I learn how, this is the best solution I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I think this is so effective: &lt;strong&gt;by making an effort to learn a bit of the local language, I&amp;rsquo;m helping avoid the perception that I&amp;rsquo;m an asshole tourist who sees the people in the country I&amp;rsquo;m visiting as less important than I am.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m a newcomer who&amp;rsquo;s trying to learn, but hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten it all figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to help each other when it feels like teamwork, or when they see someone struggling to figure something out. A few of the people we&amp;rsquo;ve interacted with have actually taken extra time to help us translate menus, and it felt like they were genuinely pleased to have helped us learn something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/tourists.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;tourists&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Dad Spanish: &#34;I WOULD LIKE EL STEAK-O!&#34;

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if I sit down and immediately start ordering in Dad Spanish, I&amp;rsquo;ve just shown that I&amp;rsquo;m willing to make zero effort, but I expect a big effort and a lot of help from the person I&amp;rsquo;m talking to. This is disrespectful, and it puts me at odds with the person I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with — hardly a productive way to handle a situation where I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an enormous benefit for very little effort. For example, in Spanish, all you have to say is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lo siento, no hablo español.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;excuse-me:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Excuse Me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m walking down the street — especially in more heavily touristed areas — I&amp;rsquo;m inevitably going to bump into people.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pedestrians&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pedestrians&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Rather than staring at them wide-eyed or saying something they won&amp;rsquo;t understand, I &lt;strong&gt;learn how to say a polite &amp;ldquo;excuse me&amp;rdquo; in their language,&lt;/strong&gt; which shows respect — I&amp;rsquo;m speaking their language — and avoids misunderstanding — they may not get my meaning when I say, &amp;ldquo;Sorry &amp;lsquo;bout that, pal!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Romance languages, these are often pretty similar to the English words you already know. For example, in Italian you would say, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scuzi!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; In Spanish, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perdón!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; French: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Excusez-moi.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also helps politely get someone&amp;rsquo;s attention, making it doubly useful to learn right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-mind-your-manners:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Step 2: Mind Your Manners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m going to be an idiot, I&amp;rsquo;m at least going to be a polite idiot. &lt;strong&gt;Figuring out the basics of being polite makes every interaction more friendly.&lt;/strong&gt; This, I hope, slightly eases the imminent pain&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pain&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pain&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and frustration I&amp;rsquo;m about to cause the person I&amp;rsquo;m speaking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-thank-you:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Please &amp;amp; Thank You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all you need. Learn them, and use them often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re American and headed to a Spanish-speaking country, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you&amp;rsquo;ve heard these before: &lt;em&gt;por favor&lt;/em&gt; (please) and &lt;em&gt;gracias&lt;/em&gt; (thank you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-learn-how-to-feed-yourself:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Step 3: Learn How to Feed Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need food. Y&amp;rsquo;know, to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, my ability to locate good food makes the difference between having a good time and being utterly miserable, so &lt;strong&gt;I place a high priority on learning my way around local menus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/sea-urchin.jpg&#34;

  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Sea urchin. It&#39;s delicious, but you&#39;ll want to know you ordered it before it arrives.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ham-and-cheese:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Ham and Cheese&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans love ham and cheese. It&amp;rsquo;s on nearly every menu I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all very good news to me; I love both ham &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; seen consistently on menus is much of anything else. Turkey, beef, or chicken are available &lt;em&gt;sometimes,&lt;/em&gt; but not with anywhere near the ubiquity of good ol&amp;rsquo; ham and cheese.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:vegetarians&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:vegetarians&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My strategy to ensure I&amp;rsquo;ll always be able to find something to eat is to figure out how to translate &amp;ldquo;ham and cheese&amp;rdquo; and then pick items off the menu that feature those words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I can&amp;rsquo;t understand any of the language on a menu, this is my food security blanket: by ordering ham and cheese, there&amp;rsquo;s a better-than-50% chance I&amp;rsquo;ve just ordered either a sandwich or an omelet, and both are fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do my best to figure out more as quickly as possible so I can sample the variety of foods each city has to offer, but by starting out with ham and cheese I can at least be sure I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally order an artichoke and tripe soup for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;coffee:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/cortado-cometa.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;cafe cortado at Cometa in Barcelona, Spain&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering coffee is easy in almost any language — if you see an espresso machine and say &amp;ldquo;cafe&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll probably get the point across effectively. The trick, though, is to &lt;strong&gt;learn the way to order coffee in each language so it comes the way you prefer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like my coffee with a little milk, which means I need to figure out what it&amp;rsquo;s called locally. In Italy, this is easy (assuming any amount of time spent in or near an American coffee shop): &lt;em&gt;cappuccino.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:cappuccino&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:cappuccino&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Spanish, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as easy — the terminology isn&amp;rsquo;t used in American cafes. &lt;em&gt;Café con leche&lt;/em&gt; (coffee with milk) is a rough equivalent to the Italian cappuccino, and the &lt;em&gt;café cortado&lt;/em&gt; is a rough equivalent of the &lt;em&gt;macchiato&lt;/em&gt; (a shot of espresso with just a dollop of steamed milk and foam).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some this may not seem like a big deal; to me, this is a non-negotiable entry in my emergency phrasebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-i-don-t-like:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Things I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a picky eater, it&amp;rsquo;s far easier for me to &lt;strong&gt;figure out which food items I&amp;rsquo;d like to avoid&lt;/strong&gt; than to learn all the things I might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list of dislikes is very short: I don&amp;rsquo;t want to order fish unless I&amp;rsquo;m in a restaurant that specializes in fish, and if I&amp;rsquo;m given a choice I&amp;rsquo;ll take the option without spinach or kale.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:spinach&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:spinach&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I learn those words and pick around them on a menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By knowing what I want to avoid, it&amp;rsquo;s far less frightening to pick something I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried off the menu. This allows me to be more adventurous in my food choices without running the risk of ordering something I know &lt;em&gt;for sure&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d rather not eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-for-the-bill:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;Ask for the Bill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in restaurants is that no one will bring you the bill until you ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/la-cuenta.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;the bill at a restaurant&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Paying for things is harder than you might think.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s out of politeness or something else, but after the waiter clears our plates and confirms that we don&amp;rsquo;t want anything else — if we forget to ask for the bill — we&amp;rsquo;ll spend the next fifteen minutes trying to catch his eye again so we can pay and leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proved extremely frustrating when I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ask for it. After I got sick of waving my credit card at people, I figured I should add this to my must-learn phrases in every language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Spain, when the waiter comes to clear our plates and asks if we want anything else, I decline politely and ask, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;¿La cuenta, por favor?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (The check, please?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-your-must-learn-phrases:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f&#34;&gt;What Are Your Must-Learn Phrases?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the phrases you rely on most when you travel? Have you run into frustration with communicating while abroad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click through to the discussion and share your story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>Travel Essentials: The Uniform</title>
      <link>http://lengstorf.com/travel-essentials-uniform</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the toughest challenges of &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/&#34;&gt;my experiment in long-term remote living and travel&lt;/a&gt; was figuring out how I was going to dress myself out of a carry-on suitcase for an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/exofficio-shirt.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Exofficio shirt&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  I don&#39;t captain a boat, so this look really isn&#39;t for me.

    &lt;small&gt;Credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exofficio.com/products/details/mens-air-strip-long-sleeve-shirt&#34;&gt;Exofficio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never considered myself to be fashionable,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:fashion&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:fashion&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so my first instinct was to cop out and buy everything from a &amp;ldquo;world traveler&amp;rdquo; type of company like Exofficio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screw it: I&amp;rsquo;d look like a retired-comptroller-turned-sailing-enthusiast, and uppity fashion snobs who would scoff at my cargo pockets and armpit air vents could kiss my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with going sailboat captain, though, is that in recent years &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve really started to enjoy building my own style.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of help from my friends with good fashion sense, and over the last couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve built up a semi-respectable wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wearing an outfit that&amp;rsquo;s stylish makes me feel like an adult. I have a sense of being put together, and that helps me move through my day-to-day life with a little more confidence. It&amp;rsquo;s a small detail, but one that makes a noticeable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forfeit my fashion sense while I travel&lt;/strong&gt; — this means copping out wasn&amp;rsquo;t (and isn&amp;rsquo;t) an acceptable option for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I took a look at what some of the men in the fashion industry were doing, and I saw something interesting: &lt;em&gt;a lot of these fashionable men wear the same thing every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/men-wearing-a-uniform.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;men wearing uniforms: Barack Obama, Tom Ford, Michael Kors, and Steve Jobs&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  In their uniforms (left to right): Barack Obama, Tom Ford, Michael Kors, and Steve Jobs.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Ford and Michael Kors wear almost the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; same outfit every day. Their uniform is a kind of trademark for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I noticed the uniform on fashion designers, I started to notice it on other well-known people, such as Barack Obama and Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that a lot of fashionable women, including Vera Wang, do the same thing. But I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend to have an opinion on what the ladies should pack for long-term travel, so I&amp;rsquo;m only focusing on men&amp;rsquo;s clothing. My travel partner Marisa Morby has written a post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marisamorby.com/blog/2015/1/12/dressing-for-a-year&#34;&gt;how she&amp;rsquo;s dressing for a year of travel&lt;/a&gt;; I&amp;rsquo;d recommend her post over mine for the ladies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This uniform thing looked promising. I could wear the same thing every day and still look fashionable? Yes, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-a-uniform-is-a-good-idea:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Why a Uniform Is a Good Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I carry everything I own in a bag at least once every couple months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; motivation to pack light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing to wear a uniform &lt;em&gt;eliminates options&lt;/em&gt;, which reduces the number of items needed to put outfits together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the simplicity removes a decision from my morning.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:decisions&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:decisions&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And while I&amp;rsquo;m not making hundreds of critical decisions every day, I do want to cut down on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all&#34;&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible to leave that mental space available for the decisions I actually care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-choose-a-uniform:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;How to Choose a Uniform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came down to actually &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; the uniform, I struggled a bit. This is what I&amp;rsquo;ll wear every day, so it should be a really stellar outfit, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I try to make a statement and rock a huge bowtie like Alber Elbaz? Suit-shorts like Thom Browne?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/alber-elbaz-thom-browne.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;Alber Elbaz and Thom Browne&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  This might be more than I&#39;m willing to commit to.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should go for the ultra-casual look Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are known for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly entertained the idea of becoming The Guy In Brightly-Colored Chinos. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;d always wear ostrich boots. Or I could give &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Craig+Sager&#34;&gt;Craig Sager&lt;/a&gt; a run for his money with my brightly-colored getups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, I started to feel like maybe this was all too much work and something that only the famous and ultra-chic can pull off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-it-simple:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Keep It Simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief existential meltdown — &lt;em&gt;what does fashion even mean, anyways?&lt;/em&gt; — I realized I was horribly overcomplicating the concept. &lt;strong&gt;The entire goal of a uniform is to &lt;em&gt;simplify&lt;/em&gt; your wardrobe,&lt;/strong&gt; not add a bunch of extra work to it. I should be looking at what I &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; wear most of the time, and putting my uniform together from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at my closet and considered how each article of clothing was worn through different seasons. What did I wear year round? What did I only wear for a particular season (and was there a way to replace those items with something less seasonal)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I started thinking along the lines of simplicity, the process became far less overwhelming, and my uniform started coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-it-flexible:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Keep It Flexible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I won&amp;rsquo;t be traveling with a full closet, &lt;strong&gt;my uniform needs to be appropriate for &lt;em&gt;any situation&lt;/em&gt; I find myself in.&lt;/strong&gt; Can I wear it to a fancy steak dinner at an upscale restaurant? A dive bar? A business meeting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  Not exactly a practical outfit.

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of looking sharp, but packing a tuxedo requires an awful lot of space in my suitcase for a very small number of situations. I needed to look at more moderate options — something that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get me barred from an upscale venue, but that I could also wear in casual situations without looking severely overdressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, I looked at my wardrobe and tried to think of ways that I could take my basic uniform and dress it up or down with a few simple (and easy to carry) accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-uniform:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;My Uniform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, my uniform consists of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solid-colored t-shirt (usually black)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeans or dark chinos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boots or sneakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my base. It&amp;rsquo;s casual on its own, which feels comfortable and easy to manage. (And — truth be told — I&amp;rsquo;m pretending it makes me look like Ryan Gosling.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/images/jason-lengstorf-ryan-gosling.jpg&#34;

  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    
  Hey girl, do I look like Ryan Gosling in my t-shirt and jeans?

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel comfortable wearing this outfit to nearly any event or meeting I can imagine myself being invited to, and it&amp;rsquo;s very low maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a touch of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a Grown Up&amp;rdquo; to the outfit, I always wear a reasonably nice watch.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:watch&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:watch&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not one for a lot of accessories, so a watch is usually as far as I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dressing-up-a-uniform:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Dressing Up a Uniform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasions where I need to look a little fancier, I pack one tweed blazer. Over my jeans, it&amp;rsquo;s only a little dressy; over the chinos it looks almost fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a blazer isn&amp;rsquo;t right, I also have two sweaters; these dress up the outfit a little bit without looking too dressy. (They also serve a dual purpose, which I&amp;rsquo;ll touch on a bit later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I&amp;rsquo;d planned to bring a pair of nice (ish) shoes, but I opted to just wear my work boots instead; they &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; look like dress shoes, and I wanted to avoid taking up the extra space in my bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adapting-a-uniform-to-warm-weather:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Adapting a Uniform to Warm Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For warm weather, I have a pair of linen shorts and a pair of board shorts that doubles as a swimming suit. Both are small, so I can roll them up and tuck them into a small crevice in my bag. A t-shirt and shorts is a simple casual outfit, and in warm weather there&amp;rsquo;s not much else I&amp;rsquo;d want to wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pack a pair of flip flops for warm days and beaches, which also come in handy for shared bathrooms and showers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adapting-a-uniform-to-colder-weather:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Adapting a Uniform to Colder Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that — assuming you&amp;rsquo;re traveling for an extended period of time and you have some control over your schedule — you can usually control the weather for your trip by choosing locations that fall within a range you deem comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal while traveling is to avoid any climate where the temperature drops below 40°F/5°C. This eliminates the need to pack &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; heavy winter gear and simplifies my packing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently pack a light cotton jacket and a slightly heavier overcoat. On their own, these are both great fall weather jackets, and since I tend to be too hot before I&amp;rsquo;m too cold, they&amp;rsquo;re usually more than enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;take-advantage-of-layers:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Take Advantage of Layers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The secret to staying warm with a uniform is layering.&lt;/strong&gt; Those sweaters I mentioned earlier go a long way toward adding some warmth, and fit nicely under my lighter-weight jackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pack a scarf that looks nice under my lightweight jacket or my overcoat and — using a sweater as a makeshift liner — makes both coats nice and warm as long as the temperature doesn&amp;rsquo;t dip below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; packed — and we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I regret it later — is a hat or gloves.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:milan&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:milan&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m usually just fine with my hands in my pockets, and my ears don&amp;rsquo;t get too chilly when the temperature is above freezing.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:bear&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:bear&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-uniform-should-make-sense-for-you:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Your Uniform Should Make Sense for You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uniform makes perfect sense for my taste: I prefer weather that stays in the sort-of-cool to warm range, where I can wear jeans and a light jacket, so I&amp;rsquo;ve built a uniform around that look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re into winter sports and expect to be in cold climates, your uniform will probably look a little different&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:coldweather&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:coldweather&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from mine. Likewise if all of your travel takes you to tropical climes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you start putting together your uniform, consider three factors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I actually feel comfortable wearing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type(s) of weather should I be expecting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind(s) of events, venues, and situations will I find myself in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to those questions help eliminate unnecessary items until you can assemble a uniform that meets all your different needs and maximizes the space in your suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remember-this-is-not-final:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Remember: This Is Not Final&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t bring something and you end up needing it, you can always purchase that item while you&amp;rsquo;re traveling.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:shoppingabroad&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:shoppingabroad&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you can&amp;rsquo;t think of a realistic, &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; scenario where you&amp;rsquo;ll use an item, &lt;em&gt;leave it behind.&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t carry around crampons and a pickaxe because you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; go rock climbing if you meet someone on your travels who is also a rock climber and you&amp;rsquo;re invited; leave that shit behind and rent equipment for the one or two days you&amp;rsquo;ll use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because it fits in your bag doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need it. And just because you didn&amp;rsquo;t pack it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t get it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans will change. &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/jazz/&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to go exactly the way you&amp;rsquo;re picturing it.&lt;/a&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it: you can adjust as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-you-wear-a-uniform:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413&#34;&gt;Do You Wear a Uniform?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you consider wearing the same outfit every day? Or does that sound horrible to you? Jump over to the discussion and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the finer points of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:fashion&#34;&gt;In high school I was the polar opposite of fashionable: I once wore a form-fitting, ribbed, stretchy, white shirt under a tan fisherman-style vest that would have looked great on a boy band, with grey vinyl pants covered in reflectors (with 45&amp;rdquo; leg openings) and glow-in-the-dark shoes. I wish I was making this shit up.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:decisions&#34;&gt;This was one of the most common reasons the famous folks cited when asked about their uniforms. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to pare down decisions.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:watch&#34;&gt;I would love to graduate to the fancy watches, but that Panerai isn&amp;rsquo;t quite within my reach yet.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:milan&#34;&gt;After a week in Milan, I decided it was the right decision not to bring gloves. It was around freezing the whole time, and while gloves wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have hurt, I was also plenty warm with my hands in my pockets.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:milan&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:bear&#34;&gt;The fact that I&amp;rsquo;m about 25% bear doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt; I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to be too warm than too cold.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13b359e258b39e3624df2abb8e079413:coldweather&#34;&gt;Probably not too terribly different, though. With long underwear, a winter hat, and warmer socks, I could probably handle fairly cold weather without being too miserable.

      <guid>http://lengstorf.com/leaving</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was eating leftovers over the sink with plastic silverware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous morning, Marisa, her mother, and I had braved the line at Screen Door for one last Portland brunch. I finished the remnants of my chicken and waffles, doing my best to not to make a mess on the freshly-scrubbed counter and floor in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apartment was completely empty. The cleaning service had left it sparkling. There was so much reverb when I spoke that it felt closer to an echo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The giant living room I&amp;rsquo;d loved so much was bare. I&amp;rsquo;d taken the blanket and pillows we&amp;rsquo;d slept on the night before out to the trash.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nicole from the cleaning service had taken nearly everything else — &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t bill you for the hour I spent loading your stuff into my car,&amp;rdquo; she texted me later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two small suitcases, two backpacks, a box of last-minute chores, and a couple small trash cans remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is everything I own,&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

       alt=&#34;everything I own in two carry-on bags&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marisa showed up around five thirty. We threw away the final few items from the fridge and tossed the trash — cans and all — into the compactor on the building&amp;rsquo;s first floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wheeled our luggage out of the apartment and I locked the door. I stopped by the manager&amp;rsquo;s office. My heart was hurling itself against the walls of my ribcage, and I ran through the checklist for the hundred-thousandth time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all done. The apartment is empty. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to forget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a little dizzy as I dropped the keys in the mail slot. They hit the bottom of the container on the other side with a nauseating finality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m officially homeless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/&#34;&gt;my experiment in permanent travel&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been met with some variation on the question, &amp;ldquo;Are you excited?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactions from my friends and family have ranged from excitement and good-natured jealousy to near-panic and quiet disapproval,&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:disapproval&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:disapproval&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but — regardless of their view — everyone wants to know how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling about the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a question that feels like small talk. But as I went through the motions of responding — &amp;ldquo;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a great adventure!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I know, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard amazing things about Italy!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;There won&amp;rsquo;t be any pizza left by the time I leave!&amp;rdquo; — pointed out something disconcerting to me as the kick-off date drew nearer: &lt;em&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling excited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t nervous. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t afraid. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t second-guessing my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight DAL418 to Milan was to me — as far as I was emotionally processing things — just another flight. My 59th of the year. Another 3,982 miles added to my SkyMiles balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t emotionally addressing this trip concerned me a little. Was I compartmentalizing too much? Was I bottling up my excitement and fear, wiring up an emotional booby trap that could detonate at at any moment? Was I in for a truly spectacular breakdown in JFK, collapsed in on myself in the Terminal 4 Starbucks, sobbing uncontrollably, feeling a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of repressed feelings all at once?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before the flight, I was restless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the work was done. The tickets were purchased. All we had left to do was show up at the airport on time in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate our last meal in Portland at Robo Taco around nine. We ordered burritos and settled into a dimly lit corner. To my left, a muted television played PBS reruns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you okay?&amp;rdquo; Marisa asked me between bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was giddy. Nervous. Excited. Relieved that the work of severing my ties to Oregon was finally done. Happy that I&amp;rsquo;d found a traveling partner. Scared that I was jumping with both feet into a world I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This feels like the first day of school,&amp;rdquo; I said. I was eating my burrito with a fork and knife because I&amp;rsquo;d squeezed too hard and broken the tortilla, spilling the contents out the back. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m happy and sad and excited and scared. It&amp;rsquo;s that feeling of &amp;lsquo;into the unknown&amp;rsquo;, you know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation lulled as we finished eating, and we watched Bob Ross paint some happy little trees. Then we headed for the airport hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At four this morning, Marisa&amp;rsquo;s alarm went off. She got up to shower, and I went back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ten to six we were in the security line. Six fifteen we were at the gate with coffee in hand. On the plane by seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, I&amp;rsquo;m somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean, getting further and further away from a home I no longer have. All of my former possessions are settling into new homes with the friends and strangers on Craigslist who bought them. The apartment I locked up last night has already been rented to new tenants; I imagine they&amp;rsquo;ll start moving in this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I own in the world is in two bags: one at my feet, and one above my head. I didn&amp;rsquo;t leave behind a storage unit, or an attic-load of furniture for my parents to hold onto. &lt;em&gt;This is it.&lt;/em&gt; These bags. The clothes I&amp;rsquo;m wearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few hours I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Milan, Italy, hauling my two bags into a stranger&amp;rsquo;s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be sleeping to ward off the imminent jet lag, but I&amp;rsquo;m still restless. I can feel the weight of my eyelids, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about the adventures that lie ahead — pizza! gelato! and I guess some old buildings and stuff&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:food&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:food&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — and the problems I haven&amp;rsquo;t solved yet.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;rsquo;t feel as excited as is maybe appropriate. And I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t feel as worried as my mom probably is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel a pressure building in my chest and throat that makes me want to either burst into laughter or tears. I feel proud that I have built a career that allows me to take this trip. I feel lucky to live in an age where technology allows a lifestyle like this to exist. I feel hopeful that my research and preparation will prove to be at least mostly correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure how I should feel about all of this. But I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely sure that I&amp;rsquo;m ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations&#34;&gt;I sold, donated, or gave away nearly everything I owned that was suitable for reuse. However, bedding is gross to share with a stranger, and my sheets had worn to the point where — a couple weeks prior to throwing them away — a hole had opened up near my (apparently) razor-sharp toenails.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:disapproval&#34;&gt;Not disapproval in the sense of, &amp;ldquo;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do this, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad idea,&amp;rdquo; but more in the sense of, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how you&amp;rsquo;re going to make this work and therefore cannot condone your actions.&amp;rdquo; No one has told me I &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; take this trip; I&amp;rsquo;ve just had a few people find the whole concept too big and daunting, and from them I&amp;rsquo;ve been met with a lot of uncomfortable silences and worried groans. (&amp;ldquo;Mom, I&amp;rsquo;m going to live in Europe for a year.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Mom emits a sound similar to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/F_XaIuw6K6Q?t=9s&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tina in&lt;/em&gt; Bob&amp;rsquo;s Burgers&lt;/a&gt;.)

 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:food&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems&#34;&gt;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure how this whole &amp;ldquo;unlocked phone with a SIM card&amp;rdquo; thing will work. I forgot to save the directions to the first Airbnb, so I need to find wifi access before we can get there. I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian. I just learned that &lt;a href=&#34;http://barcelona.de/en/barcelona-languages.html&#34;&gt;people in Barcelona speak Catalan&lt;/a&gt;, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know was a language until a few days ago.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
