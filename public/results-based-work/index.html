<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re given a task at your salaried job: you have to write a year-end summary of your department&rsquo;s most valuable projects, which will be used to guide next year&rsquo;s project selection.</p>

<p>You get right to work and knock out the whole report in two days. Your boss is pleasantly surprised at your speed, but nothing can happen until a coworker finishes the report for his department.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there&rsquo;s a box of invoices that need to be audited, and since you&rsquo;re ahead of schedule can you take care of it?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, your coworker takes a week and a half to finish the report. It&rsquo;s mentioned that you finished faster, but that&rsquo;s about the closest thing to a reprimand he&rsquo;ll hear.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re clearly more productive, but your coworker is rewarded: he made <em>way more money</em> for doing far less work.</strong></p>

<p>You were both paid for time, not output.</p>

<h2 id="the-danger-of-butts-in-chairs:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">The Danger of Butts In Chairs</h2>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s hard to measure output, many companies have reverted to a much simpler, horribly inefficient approach to tracking an employee&rsquo;s worth: butts in chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Rather than asking what someone produced, they ask how many hours he worked.</strong></p>

<p>Is it effective at telling who&rsquo;s a good employee? No.</p>

<p>Is it helpful in determining who the company&rsquo;s stars are? Nope.</p>

<p>Does it help motivated employees stay motivated? <a href="http://discover.umn.edu/news/arts-humanities/flexible-schedules-and-results-oriented-work-environments-reduce-work-family">Exactly the opposite</a>, in fact.</p>

<p>But it <em>does</em> remove the need to do a little extra legwork for management, so â€” despite the fact that it&rsquo;s arguably one of the absolute worst management metrics available â€” it still gets used.</p>

<h3 id="time-based-management-means-rewarding-poor-performance:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Time-Based Management Means Rewarding Poor Performance</h3>

<p><strong>In a culture where the only deliverable is time spent at the office, the business is actively encouraging employees to do less.</strong></p>

<p>A project that should only take a day gets stretched out to two, because who cares? There&rsquo;s <em>nothing to be gained</em> by working quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-frightening-economics-of-time-based-management:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">The Frightening Economics of Time-Based Management</h2>

<p>For an employee, the economics look like this: that hypothetical report from the beginning of this post took you two days to finish, or 16 hours.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say your salary is $50,000/year. That means that you get paid roughly $24/hour. So for finishing that report, you made about $385.</p>

<p>Your coworker, who spent a week and a half (say 56 hours) doing the same project at the same salary was paid about $1,345 for the same job.</p>

<p>You, by working quickly, were punished for your efficiency. The message being sent is, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about how long it takes; you get paid the same salary whether it&rsquo;s done today or done in a month.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="how-to-stop-rewarding-failure:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">How to Stop Rewarding Failure</h2>

<p>To solve the problem where your less-efficient coworker gets rewarded, imagine a results-based office instead.</p>

<p>Your boss assigns a project to you and your coworker and sets a due date of the following Monday, giving you six business days (48 hours) to complete the task.</p>

<p>Based on your salary, your boss has just valued this project at about $1,150.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s assume that you still get it done in 16 hours.</p>

<p>Because the business is results-based, you are now free to do whatever you want until the following Monday, and you just made $71.88/hour for creating that reportÂ â€” <strong>your efficiency was just rewarded with a higher hourly rate.</strong></p>

<p>Your coworker, on the other hand, manages to spend all of the allotted time plus a couple late nights working on the report, and still somehow manages to take 56 hours to create the report. He&rsquo;s just lowered his hourly rate to $20.54.</p>

<p>This is far more rewarding to efficient employees.</p>

<h2 id="how-rewarding-the-right-employees-helps-businesses:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">How Rewarding the Right Employees Helps Businesses</h2>

<p>For a business that implements a results-based environment, <a href="http://gorowe.com/pages/about-rowe">the rewards</a> are also huge.</p>

<h3 id="easily-spot-star-employees:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Easily Spot Star Employees</h3>

<p>A results-based company needs to spot stars in the company â€” the people who seem to always get done ahead of schedule â€” and move them to more important, higher-value projects. When employees are measured by their results, this is extremely easy.</p>

<p><strong>Spotting and rewarding star employees creates an incentive for employees to work more efficiently,</strong> which is good for morale, deadlines, and pretty much everything else businesses want to improve.</p>

<h3 id="spot-problem-employees-quickly:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Spot Problem Employees Quickly</h3>

<p>Measuring results instead of time helps the company identify, coach, and â€” if necessary â€” weed out problem employees.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to just coast along in a company where you&rsquo;re measured by results, so <strong>employees who don&rsquo;t get much done are quickly identified by their low output.</strong></p>

<h3 id="save-a-small-fortune-on-salaries:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Save a Small Fortune on Salaries</h3>

<p>How much of a company&rsquo;s payroll goes toward funding Facebook and Reddit sessions?</p>

<p>When a company shifts to results-based systems, measuring output and whether an employee is earning their salary suddenly becomes not only possible, but easy.</p>

<p>Instead of reviews relying on a manager&rsquo;s memory and how many days an employee was absent, it&rsquo;s suddenly possible to measure exact output:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pat was paid $50,000 for the year, and during that time turned in 35 projects that we valued at a total of $50,500 â€” clearly Pat&rsquo;s salary was earned, and we could even consider a small raise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terry was paid $50,000 for the year, and during that time turned in 30 projects that we valued at a total of $43,300. We need to coach Terry and see a marked improvement or we&rsquo;ll have to consider termination.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Terry&rsquo;s inefficiency may not have been caught without measuring resultsÂ â€” a $6,700 oversight.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-the-change:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">How to Make the Change</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re caught in a business that values time over results, or if you&rsquo;re a manager or employer that&rsquo;s fallen into the butts-in-chairs trap, there&rsquo;s still hope.</p>

<p>It will take an effort, but if <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/psychology_of_management/2014/05/best_buy_s_rowe_experiment_can_results_only_work_environments_actually_be.html">industry giants</a> can implement and benefit from it, so can you.</p>

<h3 id="start-figuring-out-what-needs-to-be-done:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Start Figuring Out What Needs to Be Done</h3>

<p>If you find that you&rsquo;re unable to clearly state what needs to be done in an organization, drop everything and start by defining what the result needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>Managers can&rsquo;t expect anyone to be effective if there&rsquo;s not a <a href="http://lengstorf.com/effective-project-planning/">clear plan</a> in place for what needs to be done.</strong></p>

<p>Employees can&rsquo;t do good work if they&rsquo;re not 100% clear on what &ldquo;good work&rdquo; means in the context of the company.</p>

<p>Before you can measure results, you need to <em>define the results to be measured.</em></p>

<h3 id="make-a-case-to-the-boss:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Make a Case to the Boss</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not at the top of your organization, you&rsquo;re at the mercy of higher-ups. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re helpless, however.</p>

<p>Bring up the detriments of butts-in-chairs to your boss. Talk about the benefits to everyone of results-based work.</p>

<p>If the people at the top are actually interested in making the company better, they&rsquo;ll take what you have to say into consideration.</p>

<p>Be smart about it, though, because your boss won&rsquo;t likely change everything just because you waved this article in her face.</p>

<p>Instead, make a small suggestion: <strong>as an experiment, your team could try a results-based arrangement and report back after 3â€“6 months with findings.</strong> Figure out a way to measure results that will get management excited, and put a plan in place.</p>

<p>Once your team has demonstrated that results-based management gets results, your boss will take ownership of the idea and run it up the ladder, hopefully creating a ripple effect that helps move the whole company to a better arrangement.</p>

<p>And even if it doesn&rsquo;t, your team will likely be allowed to keep up the same arrangement â€”Â after all, you <em>were</em> more productive.</p>

<h3 id="vote-with-your-feet:066e8470fa035a33749e94d4dbd891a3">Vote with Your Feet</h3>

<p>If your organization doesn&rsquo;t respond and insists that your only value to the company is your butt in a chair for 8+ hours a day, then <strong>it may be time to look at other options.</strong></p>

<p>There are results-based employment options ranging from the obvious (software and copywriting) to the entry-level (customer support) to the unbelievable (accounting firms).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s stressful to hunt for a new job, but there are <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">lots</a> <a href="http://www.flexjobs.com/jobs">of</a> <a href="http://jobs.remotive.io/">options</a> for finding remote work.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t change your culture, <strong>don&rsquo;t let yourself be the one who&rsquo;s punished for someone else&rsquo;s incompetence.</strong></p>

                <p>For many freelancers, selling is the worst part of the job. Fortunately, the kind of selling that sucks most isn&#39;t actually required to get new clients.</p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
