<p>&ldquo;You do realize you&rsquo;re very late,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I was in the Dublin Airport, heading back to Portland, Oregon. I&rsquo;d shown up ninety minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off â€”Â plenty of time, I had assumed, unaware that US Customs was handled on the Dublin side of this flight â€”Â and the guy behind the ticket counter advised me that I &ldquo;may want to run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lugged my duffel up onto my right shoulder, clutched my computer bag to my left side, and started jogging toward security. I was winded almost immediately; I reached the security line panting and miserable.</p>

<p>By the time I got to the US Customs line, I was drenched in sweat, and my right shoulder was on fire from hauling the duffel.</p>

</p>

<p>During the agriculture inspection, I heard the final boarding call for my flight. I snatched my bags from the belt and sprinted for the gate, breathlessly waving my boarding pass at the gate agent as she was about to close the boarding door.</p>

<p>I spent the next seven hours feeling my muscles knot up and wondering just how bad I must have smelled.</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s gotta be a better way to travel,</em> I thought to myself.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-well-is-an-art:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">Traveling Well Is an Art</h2>

<p>My experience in Dublin helped me realize I was making a lot of mistakes in my travel, and nearly all of them were related to the gear I was using. I had the wrong bag â€” a big, awkward duffel â€” and a lot of junk in it that added too much weight and too little value.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve worked to <strong>refine my travel gear to just the essentials:</strong> all the right luggage, clothing, and accessories to ensure I&rsquo;m set up for remote work and extended travel <em>without making travel days miserable.</em></p>

<h2 id="part-i-choose-the-right-luggage:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">Part IÂ â€” Choose the Right Luggage</h2>

<p>After putting in a lot of miles with several different bags, I&rsquo;ve developed some strong preferences based on my experience with each.</p>

<p>Since I travel with a carry-on only, I get two bags on each trip:</p>

<ol>
<li>A suitcase or duffel bag for the overhead bin</li>
<li>A smaller bag that I can stuff under the seat in front of me</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-a-carry-on-suitcase-or-duffel-for-the-overhead-bin:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">1. A Carry-On Suitcase or Duffel for the Overhead Bin</h3>

<p>When I first started traveling heavily, I was pretty judgmental about rolling bags. I thought they were for the lazy and spoiled, so I bought a <a href="http://amzn.to/1F01AWe">big traveler&rsquo;s backpack</a> without wheels<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:womens-bag"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:womens-bag">1</a></sup> and put on a smug face as I lugged it through the airport, wearing the sweat stain growing on my back as a merit badge; I was a <em>real</em> traveler â€” these other lazy bastards were just tourists.</p>

<p>Then, later, I realized I was being an idiot because having a bag that doesn&rsquo;t roll <em>sucks.</em> I decided to upgrade to a better carry-on bag.</p>

<p>After reading a lot of reviews, I decided I didn&rsquo;t want the <em>fancy</em> fancy bagsÂ â€” no need to blow a ton of cash on something just for the brand name. (And, if you swing toward the alarmist end of the spectrum, a thief would likely target a traveler dragging around a thousand-dollar suitcase: there&rsquo;s a far better chance that the things inside are similarly high-priced compared to a traveler with cheap luggage.)</p>

<p>That being said, I also didn&rsquo;t want a piece of crap bag that I&rsquo;d need to replace after a year or so of heavy use.</p>

<p>So I opted for something in the upper-mid range that had everything I needed: <a href="http://amzn.to/1FPbZW3"><strong>the Briggs &amp; Riley Transcend Carry-On Bag</strong></a>.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>I love this bag for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, <em>the construction is sturdy.</em> The handle doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going to snap off, and the wheels are still rolling true after about 40 flights.</p>

<p>Second, it has <em>exactly the right amount of storage</em> for what I travel with. The pockets inside fit my two toiletry bags perfectly, and the front pockets are good for cables that don&rsquo;t need to go in my small bag. There&rsquo;s also a skinny pocket between the handle supports on the back that&rsquo;s perfect for a sunglasses case.</p>

<p>Finally, it has a separator that clips together so I can put socks, underwear, and shoes at the bottom, strap &lsquo;em down, then put my shirts and pants on top. Or, after a few days, my dirty clothes and shoes at the bottom and the clean stuff on top.</p>

<p>Nowadays, rolling my bag next to me with one hand, backpack set nicely on top, coffee in my free hand, I don&rsquo;t feel like a sellout. I feel like a man who will arrive at his destination clean and ready to go, rather than disheveled and soaked in sweat.</p>

<h3 id="2-a-small-bag-to-put-under-the-seat:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">2. A Small Bag to Put Under the Seat</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of backpacks. Even the big traveler&rsquo;s backpack I used to travel with before I got the Briggs &amp; Riley was always carried as a duffel with the straps zipped away.</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;ve always leaned toward the shoulder bag.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:murse"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:murse">2</a></sup> It felt more grown-up against the schoolboy look of a backpack.</p>

<p>But my bag is fairly heavy when it&rsquo;s loaded with my computer, chargers, and miscellaneous electronics I need or want to have with me. And after carrying around a messenger bag for a good number of years, I ended up with a noticeable imbalance between my shoulders.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:thriller"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:thriller">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Deep tissue massages hurt like hell, so I made the decision to get over my aversion to backpacks. In the beginning of 2014 I switched to using a <a href="http://amzn.to/10uwYxe"><strong>Pacsafe Venture Safe 25L GII Backpack</strong></a>, and I haven&rsquo;t once regretted the decision. I even (kind of) feel cool wearing it.</p>

</p>

<p>This is a backpack specifically designed for travel, and while some of its features strike me as paranoid â€” slash-proof straps and locking closures so you can strap it down to a chair, for example â€” others seem pretty damn smart.</p>

<p>The one that I really like is the <em>RFID-blocking passport pocket in the front.</em> It&rsquo;s big enough for me to fit both my passport and wallet inside, and it adds a little peace of mind in an age where stealing someone&rsquo;s identity is as simple as joining an open wifi network or carrying an RFID reader in your bag.</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s a laptop sleeve inside the big zippered section,</em> and an additional pocket next to the RFID pocket in the smaller front zippered section. I&rsquo;m able to fit my laptop, a Bluetooth speaker, all my charging cables, my passport and wallet, headphones, gum, a neck pillow, a hat â€” and there&rsquo;s still plenty of room to throw in a change of clothes and a towel.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii-assemble-essential-working-gear:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">Part II â€” Assemble Essential Working Gear</h2>

<p>Even on trips that I might call &ldquo;vacations&rdquo;, I still end up doing a little bit of work. I really enjoy what I do for a living, so it&rsquo;s nice to have a full day of exploring and playing, then spend part of the evening with a drink getting something productive done.</p>

<p>For that reason, I never travel without my essentials for getting work done while traveling.</p>

<h3 id="3-laptop-computer:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">3. Laptop Computer</h3>

<p>Everything I do requires a computer, so I always have one available. Currently I&rsquo;m using a <a href="http://amzn.to/1y0zmIJ"><strong>15&rdquo; MacBook Pro</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve previously worked on a 17&rdquo; MacBook Pro, but I found it to be way too big for use on an airplane. I had an 11&rdquo; MacBook Air for a long time, but the work I do in Photoshop was a little too taxing and it started to drag on me.</p>

<p>If I were to purchase a new computer right now, it would probably be a 13&rdquo; MacBook Pro, upgraded as far as it can go with RAM and processing power. That&rsquo;s small enough to use on a cramped airplane tray table, and it still provides plenty of screen real estate for working (especially with an external display).</p>

<h3 id="4-headphones:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">4. Headphones</h3>

<p>In some circumstances, I really like to sit and listen to the world around me. A coffee shop can be great for focus,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:research"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:research">4</a></sup> and the sound of the ocean makes even the most tedious tasks feel a lot less like work.</p>

<p>Most times, though, throwing on headphones and a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/2ujjMpFriZ2nayLmrD1Jgl">good working playlist on Spotify</a> is the best way for me to keep my productivity really high so I can get things done and shut down so I can eat my way across Europe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been big on over-the-ear headphones because they&rsquo;re just too bulky for my taste. I know they sound better, but to me the trade-off in sound doesn&rsquo;t justify the size.</p>

<p>For a long time I used <a href="http://amzn.to/11MZ8V0">sound-isolating in-ear headphones</a> â€” basically earplugs with holes in the middle where music is piped through â€” but I ultimately settled on using the <strong>plain old Apple headphones</strong> for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, the sound is fine to my ears. I&rsquo;m not an audiophile, and I&rsquo;m typically only wearing headphones in a space where there&rsquo;s a shitload of ambient noise, so the subtleties and nuances in the music won&rsquo;t make it through to my ears anyways.</p>

<p>Second, I like the microphone and volume control that&rsquo;s built into the cord. It&rsquo;s as good as any Bluetooth headset or bulky wired headset I&rsquo;ve found, and I don&rsquo;t feel awkward wearing them in public.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:bluetooth"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:bluetooth">5</a></sup></p>

<p>These are definitely a simple item, but I miss few things more than headphones if I forget them.</p>

<h3 id="5-tablet:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">5. Tablet</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of people switching to tablets and ditching laptops altogether, but that&rsquo;s definitely not me. I still need an actual computer to get real work done, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>However, a tablet is a great way to add a sort of Swiss Army Gadget to your travel kit. I use an iPad for a few purposes, each of which is very different from the others (and extremely useful to me).</p>

<p><strong>1. A tablet is a book.</strong> I actually prefer the Kindle&rsquo;s display since it&rsquo;s more like paper, but to avoid carrying two gadgets I&rsquo;m perfectly happy to read on my iPad.</p>

<p><strong>2. A tablet is a TV.</strong> Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll set up my iPad to play something off Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon. This is helpful for days when I feel an uncontrollable urge to watch the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70159087&amp;trkid=3325852">Countdown episode of <em>The IT Crowd</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. A tablet is good for killing time.</strong> When I only have a few minutes, or if I&rsquo;m just not in the mood to read, I&rsquo;ll use my tablet to play sudoku or some other casual game.</p>

<h3 id="6-extra-monitor:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">6. Extra Monitor</h3>

<p>I know, I know. Packing an extra monitor sounds unnecessary. But hear me out.</p>

<p>I love having a little extra screen real estate to work with; having messages and utility apps on a secondary screen helps me quickly scan what&rsquo;s happening without taking my focus away from whatever I&rsquo;m working on.</p>

<p>To that end, I picked up the <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1yX0wx5">ASUS MB168B+ monitor</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s incredibly light, and I can fit it in the laptop pocket of my backpack along with my laptop, so there&rsquo;s virtually no added bulk.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s USB-powered, which means it&rsquo;s really easy to use. However, that also means the screen&rsquo;s brightness and sharpness aren&rsquo;t on the level of bulkier monitors. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this monitor as a place for doing graphics work, but it&rsquo;s fantastic for messaging, the command line, or other text-based apps that I need to scan as I work.</p>

<h3 id="7-unlocked-smartphone:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">7. Unlocked Smartphone</h3>

<p>These days, a smartphone is more or less essential to being alive. We&rsquo;ve come to rely on our phones to tell us everything from what we&rsquo;re doing today to who loves us to where we should eat tonight.</p>

<p>Traveling abroad is no different, except it helps if your phone is &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo;. The difference, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the term, is that an <a href="http://amzn.to/1BWEIss"><strong>unlocked phone</strong></a> allows you to replace the SIM card in the phone, which means you can change it over to different providers and networks as you wander.</p>

<p>The primary benefit of this is that <em>you can continue to have a phone no matter where you are in the world.</em> Things like maps and phone calls continue to work â€” you just need to get a prepaid SIM card.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:phone-options"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:phone-options">6</a></sup></p>

<p>When no reliable wifi is available, the phone can be used as a personal wifi connection.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:hotspot"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:hotspot">7</a></sup></p>

<p>I also use my phone to take photos. I&rsquo;m not a photographer, so carrying around a &ldquo;good&rdquo; camera is a waste of luggage space in my case.</p>

<h3 id="8-bluetooth-speaker:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">8. Bluetooth Speaker</h3>

<p>As a general rule, I have music playing at all times. Whether I&rsquo;m having <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/jlengstorf/playlist/7d16muJ9zbFlQyhqXJ4V2W">a shower dance party</a>, putting on some folky tunes while I relax, or blasting ridiculous hip hop for no reason whatsoever, there&rsquo;s always something on.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>For the times when I don&rsquo;t need to keep my music to myself, I keep a Bluetooth speaker with me. I&rsquo;ve used several, but the one I like the most is the <a href="http://amzn.to/1tXFl1e"><strong>Bose Mini Soundlink portable speaker</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s got solid battery life, the sound is awesome, and it&rsquo;s not too big to stuff in the bottom of my small bag.</p>

<h2 id="part-iii-pack-the-right-toiletries:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">Part III â€” Pack the Right Toiletries</h2>

<p>Toiletries are definitely a given, and some of the things I bring with meÂ â€” toothbrush, comb, deodorant, fingernail clippers, etc. â€” aren&rsquo;t worth explaining.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:toothpaste"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:toothpaste">8</a></sup> However, a few of my toiletries might seem unnecessary or strange at first blush; I assure you, they&rsquo;re not.</p>

<h3 id="9-your-own-shampoo-and-conditioner:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">9. Your own shampoo and conditioner</h3>

<p>Almost anywhere you would stay while traveling will supply shampoo, and most will also have some kind of conditioner. Or at least the 2-in-1 combo stuff.</p>

<p>I used it for a long time. Why worry about packing extra stuff, especially when airport security only allows you a thimbleful of anything liquid?</p>

<p>What I found was that bringing my own shampoo and conditioner helped me avoid the feeling of being temporary. Using the same products that I use at home makes me feel like I&rsquo;m just having a normal day, which leads me to better productivity and less of the &ldquo;fuck it I&rsquo;m on vacation&rdquo; attitude.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth the investment to get a set of <a href="http://amzn.to/1tuz64i">travel containers</a> and fill them with your shampoo and conditioner.</p>

<h3 id="10-your-own-soap:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">10. Your own soap</h3>

<p>I hate hotel soap. It&rsquo;s too unpredictable.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s really fancy, moisturizing, made-from-upcycled-angel-wings spa soap, and other times it&rsquo;s more or less plastic that bubbles when it gets wet. And â€” this is the worst â€” sometimes it&rsquo;s in a dispenser stuck to the inside of the shower like the hand soap in a public restroom.</p>

<p>

</figure>
</p>

<p>On top of this, I&rsquo;m kind of a hippie about my soap; I like the <a href="http://amzn.to/1qMc6h2">all-natural soap</a> that&rsquo;s full of tree bark or lava rocks or whatever so I can feel it getting the dirt off me when I scrub.</p>

<p>Having my own soap also helps with routine in the same way as bringing my own shampoo and conditioner, but in this case it&rsquo;s more about knowing that I won&rsquo;t be lathering up with pink soap from a push pump every morning.</p>

<h3 id="11-baby-powder-or-gold-bond:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">11. Baby powder (or Gold Bond)</h3>

<p>When I travel, I walk <em>a lot,</em> and the climate usually isn&rsquo;t as temperate as the Pacific Northwest. A light dusting of baby powder in a few key regions helps ensure I don&rsquo;t end up feeling gross and smelly as the day wears on.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="http://amzn.to/1xBh1lz">Gold Bond medicated stuff</a> because&hellip; well, honestly because it feels fucking awesome.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:junk"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:junk">9</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="part-iv-know-what-clothes-to-pack:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">Part IVÂ â€” Know What Clothes to Pack</h2>

<p>No one would call me fashionable. However, I <em>do</em> care how I&rsquo;m dressed, and I&rsquo;m not willing to give up what little fashion sense I have when I travel.</p>

<p>While traveling, I want to find a balance between wearing nothing but <a href="http://www.exofficio.com/products/details/mens-air-strip-long-sleeve-shirt">Exofficio gear</a> and packing an extra suitcase just for accessories and stylish hats.</p>

<h3 id="12-the-uniform:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">12. The Uniform</h3>

<p>The biggest improvement I&rsquo;ve made in my style to date has been to choose &ldquo;my uniform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a concept I came up with; people far more stylish than I, like Tom Ford and Michael Kors, have adopted a uniform as a way of remaining fashionable and keeping things simple.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:trends"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:trends">10</a></sup></p>

<p>My uniform is extremely simple: a short-sleeve or <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> sleeve tee and either jeans or chinos.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:shorts"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:shorts">11</a></sup> I like this because it&rsquo;s casual enough to wear anywhere, but nice enough I can wear it at a speaking gig or in most fancy restaurants. It can be dressed up with a blazer or cardigan, or dressed down with casual shoes.</p>

<p>Having a uniform allows me to pack lighter: all of the items I pack match each other, so four t-shirts and two pairs of pants creates eight different outfits.</p>

</p>

<p>I buy my t-shirts from <a href="http://bit.ly/1FbpNXJ">American Apparel</a>, and I really like the fit of both <a href="http://amzn.to/11Fsm7g">AG Jeans</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1Fbq0dw">Bonobos</a> straight leg chinos. You&rsquo;ll rarely find me wearing anything else.</p>

<h3 id="13-the-right-shoes:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">13. The Right Shoes</h3>

<p>Packing tons of shoes is a great way to end up with a checked bag. To avoid this, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you have versatile shoes that can serve a number of purposes.</p>

<p>When I travel, I usually bring <a href="http://amzn.to/1AwehIv">Nike Frees</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1514hu3">Jack Purcell Converse All-Stars</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1vywB2x">Ariat boots</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1xfIu8s">Merrell shoes with Vibram soles</a>, and flip flops.</p>

<p>The Nikes or Converse serve as my general-purpose shoes. They work with a &ldquo;going out&rdquo; outfit, or with shorts, or with pretty much anything else I might be wearing.</p>

<p>The boots are incredibly comfortable, so I like to wear them for walking. With jeans, they actually look passable as &ldquo;nice shoes&rdquo; in case the sneakers are too casual. And if the weather isn&rsquo;t ideal, they&rsquo;re good for the rain.</p>

<p>The Merrells are great for hiking or active stuff. I like the barefoot shoes â€” the kind that <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have individual toes. If you don&rsquo;t like that, you could swap these out for sturdier hiking shoes or something more suited to the kind of outdoor play you&rsquo;re into.</p>

<p>Flip flops are always good to have around in case of a beach run, a pool, or a shared shower.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:open-toed"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:open-toed">12</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="14-4-6-days-worth-of-socks-and-underwear:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224">14. 4â€“6 days&rsquo; Worth of Socks and Underwear</h3>

<p>No matter how long I&rsquo;m gone for, <strong>I rarely pack for more than 6 days.</strong> Usually I&rsquo;ll plan my longer stays in a place that has a washer and dryer, or I&rsquo;ll go to a laundromat. As a last resort I&rsquo;ll pay for the hotel&rsquo;s laundry service.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://amzn.to/1xBCcE5">Sperry&rsquo;s no-show socks</a> for my sneakers, and I prefer <a href="http://amzn.to/1p7Uzia">SmartWool socks</a> for the boots. And â€” possible overshare, here â€” I wear <a href="http://amzn.to/1vyyyvI">Diesel boxer-briefs</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:underwear"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:22d577ac94fd840e4e071750a33f5224:underwear">13</a></sup></p>

The first one was horrible: corduroy and some kind of cheap velvet-ish liner â€” it looked like the inside of a club I imagine Ron Jeremy owns. The second was a somewhat passable effort made of black duck-cloth. The last one was actually awesome (I thought): I took tan, white, and black, and sewed them into a striped pattern. It had internal pockets with zippers and everything. I felt like goddamn Martha Stewart.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
