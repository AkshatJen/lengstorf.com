<p>One of my early jobs was at a local publishing house, where I did typesetting and rudimentary layout work for field guides. There was a guy there â€” we&rsquo;ll call him Carl â€” who handled the still-new digital aspect of the business.</p>

<p>I had built a website or two at this point. My work was total amateur hour, but I could tell that this kind of work was something I enjoyed.</p>

<p>Carl was the first person I&rsquo;d met who worked on websites for a living.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25:montana"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25:montana">1</a></sup> At the time, he represented all of the things I wanted in my career. So I looked up to him as a mentor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Carl, can I ask you a question? How can I get to where you are? What should I do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carl looked at me, sizing me up. He had a smirk on his face. His condescending gaze was amused, like, &ldquo;Who the fuck does this kid think he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>

</figure>
</p>

<p>I felt ashamed. I wanted to take my question back. I wanted to hide under the desk until Carl left for the day so I could slink home.</p>

<p>He looked at me for a long time. I shriveled under his stare, questioning everything about myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me the difference between cell padding and cell spacing?&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25:perspective"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25:perspective">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I was pretty sure I knew the answer. I thought maybe it was a trick question. I second-guessed myself. I hesitated.</p>

<p>He chuckled and shook his head, disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not ready to handle the kinds of work I do.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="carl-was-an-asshole:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25">Carl Was an Asshole</h2>

<p>Carl was forty-something years old, working a job that â€” in retrospect â€” was entry-level at best. His skill level was nothing to brag about; he could get the job done, but no one was going to knock any doors down to hire him.</p>

<p>But Carl was a big fish in a small pond. There was no competition for his job, because no one in Montana at the time was taking digital media very seriously.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption aligncenter">

</figure>
</p>

<p>This made Carl a lot like the Wizard of Oz: he was mysterious and powerful, dealing in forces that few people really understood.</p>

<p>And I was Dorothy, lost on this brand new career path, looking for someone to guide me.</p>

<p>I was an eager student. Carl was in a position to help me out.</p>

<p>Instead, he chose to be an elitist asshole and made me feel stupid for not knowing the things I&rsquo;d just asked him for help with.</p>

<h2 id="fear-of-becoming-irrelevant:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25">Fear of Becoming Irrelevant</h2>

<p>I used to think that Carl just didn&rsquo;t like me. He thought I was some dumb kid who wouldn&rsquo;t amount to much and who was probably just on his hobby of the week. Why waste time on the likes of me?</p>

<p>But I think something else may have been at play: Carl might have seen me as a threat.</p>

<p>Not directly. Carl wasn&rsquo;t thinking, &ldquo;Oh no! This kid&rsquo;s about to take my job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On some level, though, I think Carl may have seen my questions as a threat to his job security. After all, if enough people learned this stuff, it&rsquo;d be a lot more difficult for him to remain the big fish.</p>

<p>Carl wanted to be indispensable. He wanted to be the lynchpin in the organization, without which everything would go off the rails.</p>

<p>That meant treating his knowledge like a trade secret, and boxing out anyone who might weaken his grip on this job.</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t excuse humiliating a teenager for showing interest in his field of expertise.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-be-like-carl:e883b21e0e1b626efec1407fdd3ddf25">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Like Carl&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Last week I was in Boston speaking at an event.</p>

<p>On one of the evenings there was a cocktail mixer at a bar called Lucky&rsquo;s, a basement bar in South Boston. It was the sort of dimly lit, brick-walled dive where you imagine finding disreputable people discussing unsavory acts, but actually find disinterested twenty-somethings discussing undiscovered bands.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>As the night wound down, the group I was standing with was approached by this kid, <a href="http://javascriptjake.com/">Jake</a>, who looked like he was about 12 years old. He was 20, in college.</p>

<p>For a moment, I was dismissive. <em>He&rsquo;s probably out of his depth,</em> I thought. <em>I hope he doesn&rsquo;t start asking a bunch of dumb questions.</em></p>

<p>And then I was angry with myself for letting thoughts like that into my head. I remembered how it felt when I asked Carl for advice, and how humiliated I was when he talked down to me and made me feel like I was too dumb to play on his level.</p>

<p><em>Don&rsquo;t be like Carl,</em> I reminded myself.</p>

<p>Jake was outgoing, curious, personable. He asked a ton of questions, and the whole group joined in to answer them as best we could.</p>

<p>At one point I started giving him shit because he kept pulling his phone out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking notes on what you&rsquo;re saying,&rdquo; he told me.</p>

<p>This was both flattering and terrifying. <em>This kid is listening to me? Is that&hellip; Should he be doing that?</em></p>

<p>But it felt good. Here was this kid: excited to learn, passionate about building a career, and looking to me for a little guidance.</p>

<p>Jake was an eager student. I was in a position to help him out.</p>

<p>I could have been an elitist asshole. I could have done my best to assert my superiority and make him feel dumb.</p>

<p>But it felt way better to help him out.</p>

<p>And Jake felt good about things, too; later that evening, I got a note from him:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

<p>Jake will end up being pretty successful. He&rsquo;s smart, ambitious, and he&rsquo;s got a head start on his career. He&rsquo;s years ahead of where I was at his age.</p>

<p>So should I worry about Jake replacing me?</p>

<p>Maybe. But at least now I can remind him that I was a helping hand on his way up, and hope that he&rsquo;ll give me a job when he does.</p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
