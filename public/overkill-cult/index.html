<p>You didn&rsquo;t mean to end up here. You didn&rsquo;t even see it coming.</p>

<p>It all started with a chance to earn a living doing something you loved. Your dream job. Creating things instead of rotting in a cubicle. You weren&rsquo;t just going to make a living — <em>you were going to leave your mark on the world.</em></p>

<p>At first, you loved the work; it was challenging and fast-paced. Everyone around you was crazy smart.</p>

<p>You brainstormed in your off time. Took projects home with you. Put in extra hours on weekends. It never felt like overworking because it never felt like work.</p>

<p>You put in way more than 40 hours a week, but who was counting? This was <em>fun.</em></p>

<p>But weeks passed into months and somehow you ended up here: Working 60 hours a week minimum, usually more. You greet your coworkers, bleary-eyed, half-joking about needing coffee to survive.</p>

<p>The work is still fun, but you don&rsquo;t feel the same passion anymore. Whole days slip by sometimes and you have no idea what happened; you certainly don&rsquo;t have much to show for it.</p>

<p>Your goals outside of work are on hold. You&rsquo;d love to find out if the Belgians have anything to be cocky about waffle-wise, but you don&rsquo;t have time for a big trip right now. You know you need to get into an exercise routine, but something always comes up and you skip the gym.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later,&rdquo; you promise yourself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get around to it soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not exactly <em>un*happy, but something&rsquo;s off. You can&rsquo;t put your finger on it. You&rsquo;ve just always felt that there would be &hellip; *more.</em></p>

<h2 id="you-ve-been-absorbed:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">You&rsquo;ve Been Absorbed</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re no longer a free member of society. You&rsquo;ve been lured into the <strong>Overkill Cult</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Overkill Cult is a cultural delusion that working 60+ hour weeks at the expense of everything else in our lives is not only a necessary part of success, but that doing so is somehow *honorable.</strong>*</p>

<p>The insidious thing about the Overkill Cult is that it masquerades as all the things we like most about ourselves: dedication, ambition, follow-through, responsibility.</p>

<p>It tells us to push harder, stay later, sleep when we&rsquo;re dead. It tells us we&rsquo;re never going to get ahead if we don&rsquo;t show up first and go home last.</p>

<p>Cleverly, wickedly, the Overkill Cult persuades us to hang ourselves with our own strengths.</p>

<p>And if we don&rsquo;t break free, we&rsquo;re all going to die.</p>

<h2 id="the-overkill-cult-will-kill-you-like-it-tried-to-kill-me:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">The Overkill Cult Will Kill You (Like It Tried to Kill Me)</h2>

<p>Balance is the first thing to go once the Overkill Cult has us in its grasp.</p>

<p>For me, it started with my health. I skipped the gym — <em>too busy</em>, I thought. I didn&rsquo;t have time to cook — <em>too busy</em> — so I ordered delivery.</p>

<p>My hobbies went next. Everything that wasn&rsquo;t work fell away — <em>too busy, too busy</em> — until I was on the computer constantly, working.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:worklike"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:worklike">1</a></sup> <strong>In 2012, I was working 70–90 hours a week.</strong></p>

<p>After that, I lost my social life. Friends knew I wouldn&rsquo;t show up — <em>can&rsquo;t; too busy</em> — so they stopped calling. Some days my only human interaction was ordering coffee.</p>

<p>Then — and this, sadly, is where I finally realized there was a problem — I lost my beard.</p>

<h3 id="the-canary-in-the-coal-mine-or-how-i-killed-my-beard:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">The Canary in the Coal Mine, or How I Killed My Beard</h3>

<p>At the end of 2012, I landed the biggest project of my career at that point: a Black Friday sales site for a Fortune 100 company.</p>

<p>I was thrilled and terrified. A project like this had the potential to move my company to the next level, and I decided to do whatever it took to make this project the best I&rsquo;d ever built.</p>

<p>The designers had great ideas, and I sat with them to make sure they were possible on our timeline. We came up with a slick, modern idea built on cutting-edge technology. The client loved it.</p>

<p>Then bureaucracy came into play. The legal department made changes. Brand adherence contradicted legal. Design went over schedule. <em>Way</em> over schedule.</p>

<p>By the time the design was approved, I had a third of the time we&rsquo;d scheduled. And — since this was a Black Friday site — we couldn&rsquo;t push back the release date. It either launched on time or I was a failure. Period.</p>

<p>Not to be defeated, I powered through four straight days leading up to Black Friday, sleeping <em>maybe</em> six hours total. On Thanksgiving Day I skipped family get-togethers in favor of making the final push.</p>

<p>I was exhausted. Delirious. But, goddammit, <em>I finished the project.</em></p>

<p>The client was thrilled. The site won a couple Addy Awards. I assume they made a metric fuckton in holiday sales.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, patches of my beard started to turn white. The whiskers became ultra-fine. Then they fell out altogether.</p>

<p>

  May, 2013 — about six months after my Black Friday fiasco.

</figure>
</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, I lost my ability to grow a beard entirely — I was left with the unsavory choice between a clean-shaven &ldquo;giant fat baby&rdquo; look and a creepy mustache.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:mustache"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:mustache">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I had stressed myself out so badly that my body had forgotten how to grow a beard. And for what? So I could work 19-hour days and skip family holidays to meet crazy deadlines?</p>

<p>I was exhausted. My body was failing. I was overwhelmed and unhappy and isolated. <em>I had a mustache, for chrissakes.</em></p>

<p>I had been guzzling the Overkill Cult&rsquo;s Kool-Aid.</p>

<p>Something had to change.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-tell-if-you-re-in-a-cult:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">How to Tell If You&rsquo;re in a Cult</h2>

<p>The telltale signs we&rsquo;ve fallen prey to the Overkill Cult&rsquo;s influence are subtle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequently working more than 40 hours a week</li>
<li>Frequently sleeping less than 6 hours a night</li>
<li>Feeling guilty about any time away from work— even if that time is with family and friends</li>
</ul>

<p>We don&rsquo;t join overnight — this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normality">death by a thousand cuts</a> — and once we&rsquo;ve joined, we&rsquo;ll probably deny it.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:denial"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:denial">3</a></sup></p>

<p>But we&rsquo;ve joined. By the thousands, we&rsquo;ve joined.</p>

<h2 id="the-lies-of-the-overkill-cult:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">The Lies of the Overkill Cult</h2>

<p>The Overkill Cult&rsquo;s siren song seems like a healthy sense of ambition. &ldquo;We have to work hard to get ahead.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve been told our entire lives.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re doing what we think is best for the future.</p>

<p>But the Overkill Cult doesn&rsquo;t plan for survivors.</p>

<p>Though the symptoms of the Overkill Cult grow from good intentions, they&rsquo;re short-sighted habits that ultimately do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of the Overkill Cult&rsquo;s telltale signs, and how each of them is a long-term detriment disguised as a healthy work ethic.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-working-more-than-40-hours-a-week:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">Frequently Working More than 40 Hours a Week</h3>

<p>Long hours often feel mandatory — it&rsquo;s just part of the culture. We think, &ldquo;My boss/coworkers/cat will judge me if I&rsquo;m not working the same long hours as everyone else. I&rsquo;ll never get ahead if I don&rsquo;t go above and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just what it takes to make it, right?</p>

<p><strong>Wrong.</strong> Incredibly, terribly, <em>spectacularly</em> wrong.</p>

<p>Research has proven over and over again that <strong>it&rsquo;s not possible to be productive for more than 40 hours a week.</strong> At least not for sustained periods of time. Henry Ford introduced the 40-hour work week in 1914 because he saw — through research — that workers on <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/">five eight-hour shifts kept up the highest sustained levels of productivity</a>.</p>

<p>Despite over 100 years of research supporting shorter work weeks, many companies still push for long hours, under the claims of a &ldquo;sprint&rdquo; or &ldquo;crunch time&rdquo; period.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption alignright">
  <img src="http://lengstorf.com/images/overwork-hurts-productivity.jpg"
       alt="overtime causes negative productivity after a short time">
  <figcaption class="caption-text">
    
  This diagram is loosely based on one included in Sidney J. Chapman's *Hours of Labor*.

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>The irony comes in when we look at productivity over time. After just two months of 60-hour weeks, <a href="http://www.enginesofmischief.com/makers/evan/pubs/crunch.html">productivity goes <em>negative</em></a> compared to what a 40 hour week would have produced.</p>

<p>Did you catch that? <strong>By working 150% of the hours, you accomplish <em>less</em> in the long run.</strong></p>

<h3 id="frequently-sleeping-less-than-6-hours-a-night:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">Frequently Sleeping Less than 6 Hours a Night</h3>

<p>Somehow, sleeplessness has become a strange badge of honor. We swap &ldquo;war stories&rdquo; of sleeping two hours a night with an odd, martyred pride shining dimly in our bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p><em>I never sleep because <a href="http://genius.com/3012/Nas-ny-state-of-mind/I-never-sleep-cause-sleep-is-the-cousin-of-death">sleep is the cousin of death</a>,</em> we murmur drowsily. So many projects, so little time.</p>

<p>But this belief that burning the midnight oil somehow gets us ahead is utterly, tragically wrong.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/pdf/v057p00649.pdf">cognitive equivalent of a drunk driver</a> after being awake about 18 hours. But the problem compounds: if you don&rsquo;t get enough sleep, that level of impairment comes faster the next day. After a few days of too little sleep, you&rsquo;re a drunken zombie.</p>

<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t go to work drunk, so why the hell do we go to work on four hours&rsquo; sleep, when we&rsquo;re <em>more</em> impaired than if we were hammered?</p>

<p>To make matters worse, sleeping less than six hours a night <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8660373.stm">may lead to an early death</a>. The Overkill Cult is <em>literally</em> killing you.</p>

<h3 id="feeling-guilty-about-any-time-away-from-work-even-time-with-family-and-friends:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">Feeling Guilty About Any Time Away from Work — Even Time with Family and Friends </h3>

<p>When we&rsquo;re in the clutches of the Overkill Cult, we feel a stab of guilt when we&rsquo;re not working.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to go to this holiday party, but I really shouldn&rsquo;t; this project won&rsquo;t finish itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We fear that any time not spent working is wasted.</p>

<p>The irony is — yet again — science tells us <em>exactly the opposite</em> is true.</p>

<p>Overworking leads to higher stress levels and burnout, which have been linked to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/BMED.31.1.18-32#.VP2vuYGsWlI">increased health risks</a>.</p>

<p>Conversely, time away from work is proven to <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html">relieve stress</a> and <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-14435-001/">boost creativity</a>, among numerous other benefits.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:walking"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:walking">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Besides, if we accept that the ideal is to sleep 8 hours a night and work 8 hours a day, that leaves us with 8 hours<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:nonworktime"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:nonworktime">5</a></sup> for non-work activities.</p>

<p>Taking time away from work gives us time to recharge. It puts distance between us and our projects, giving us time to remember why we like doing what we do.</p>

<h2 id="making-our-escape:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">Making Our Escape</h2>

<p>While we may have been duped into joining the Overkill Cult, it&rsquo;s not too late to escape.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been conned using our own best qualities to develop habits that — even though it <em>seems</em> like they&rsquo;d make us better — make us worse at our jobs, less satisfied with our work, <em>and</em> less happy in our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>Leveraging the same strengths the Overkill Cult exploits, we can break free of its clutches and take back our happiness and passion.</p>

<p>After my beard died, I felt the full weight of burnout. <em>I was burnt to a fucking crisp.</em> I realized I could either leave my career altogether, or make some fundamental changes to my lifestyle.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, here are the promises I made to myself that helped me break away from the Overkill Cult.</p>

<h3 id="i-work-as-much-as-i-can-but-not-more:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">I Work as Much as I Can — But Not More</h3>

<p>Before anything else, I had to accept that <strong>it&rsquo;s only possible to do 6–8 hours of quality work each day.</strong></p>

<p>Trying to work longer hours will not make me more productive. In fact, working longer hours actually results in me getting less done as time drags on.</p>

<p>I chose the latter, and implemented some radical (to me) <a href="http://lengstorf.com/no-distractions-experiment/">strategies for controlling my time</a>. <strong>I cut from an average of 70–90 hours a week in 2013 to an average 38 hours per week over the last year.</strong></p>

<p>I expected to see less professional success in favor of better overall balance in my life — a sacrifice I was willing to make — instead I saw <em>better</em> productivity at work: my turn-around times went down<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:turnaround"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:turnaround">6</a></sup> and I was more consistently hitting my deadlines.</p>

<p>I was floored at the time, but in retrospect I&rsquo;m not surprised at all.</p>

<h3 id="i-make-sleep-a-top-priority:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">I Make Sleep a Top Priority</h3>

<p>Getting enough sleep is beneficial on every level. Yet it&rsquo;s always the first thing I would sacrifice when life got busy.</p>

<p>Too little sleep wreaks havoc on my ability to think clearly, and that hurts me at work in a big, bad way.</p>

<p>After I cut my hours down, I started sleeping without an alarm.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:noalarm"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0:noalarm">7</a></sup> Since I&rsquo;m not working crazy hours, I close my computer by six or seven in the evening, and by eleven I&rsquo;m usually in bed, where I read for a bit before falling asleep. I wake up naturally between seven and eight-thirty.</p>

<p>This has changed my life. No bullshit.</p>

<p>Waking up to an alarm before I&rsquo;m fully rested starts the day in a groggy, stressful way. Waking up naturally after getting as much sleep as my body needs leaves me much happier to be awake, and far more ready to start my day.</p>

<h3 id="i-dedicate-a-reasonable-amount-of-time-to-not-working:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">I Dedicate a Reasonable Amount of Time to NOT Working</h3>

<p>This was — and still is — the biggest challenge I faced in breaking away from the Overkill Cult. I love what I do, and I want to get my projects finished. It&rsquo;s easy to rationalize working more hours and skipping activities that keep me from working.</p>

<p>But now I know that taking breaks makes me more productive: time away from work lets my passion and excitement for the work renew itself; taking my mind off of a project allows my subconscious to roll around abstract ideas that result in better solutions; breaks from the job lower my stress levels and boost my creativity.</p>

<p>So I make sure to do it, even if my gut (incorrectly) tells me it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>

<p>I take walks. I leave my phone in my pocket when I&rsquo;m out with friends or eating my meals. I spend a fair amount of time on my hobbies, like writing and hunting for the world&rsquo;s best cheeseburger.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happier today than I can ever remember being in my life. I feel excited to work on my projects, to pursue my hobbies, and to spend time with people I love.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m excited to be alive.</em></p>

<h2 id="leaving-the-overkill-cult-saved-my-life:9ede6b4ba1d5c9385adce138a51754f0">Leaving the Overkill Cult Saved My Life</h2>

<p><strong>When my beard died in 2013, I feared it was only the first sign of an impending decline in my health that would ultimately kill me.</strong> It was a glimpse into my future, and I was terrified that if I didn&rsquo;t change, I was in for a life of isolation, ulcers, alopecia, and an eventual heart attack or stress-induced brain tumor.</p>

<p>By changing my lifestyle, I was able to turn things around. After just a year of balancing my work with the rest of my life, my beard grew back. I lost 30 pounds because I was actually going outside and making it to the gym. I felt more awake, and I <a href="https://medium.com/@jlengstorf/stop-glossing-over-the-good-stuff-b89e25f7c714">became more positive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When I left the Overkill Cult, <em>everything</em> in my life improved. Not one single thing got worse.</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been sucked into the Overkill Cult, know that you&rsquo;re not alone.</p>

<p>You may be facing cultural pressure to keep this crazy pace. You may be struggling with your identity as &ldquo;a hard worker&rdquo; and feeling that scaling back somehow makes you lazy or useless.</p>

<p>But I promise you — despite the doubts the Overkill Cult will force into your mind — there&rsquo;s a better way. Better for your career. Better for your health. Better for your relationships. Better for your happiness.</p>

<p>You ended up in the Overkill Cult because you&rsquo;re smart, ambitious, and dedicated. But you were misled by your good qualities and turned them into bad habits.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a better way, and you&rsquo;re smart enough to pull it off.</p>

<p>Dump your Kool-Aid in the sink. Take back your freedom. Find the happiness and success you were looking for when you started this career.</p>

<p>Close your computer. Go outside. And call your friends; they miss you.</p>

<p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t start living this life sooner.

            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
