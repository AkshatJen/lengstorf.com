<p>At fourteen, I felt a lot of rage.</p>

<p>In retrospect, my anger wasn&rsquo;t much more than the vinegar-and-baking-soda aftermath of my first waves of conscious individualism breaking against jagged, hormonal shores.</p>

<p>

  This is the face of struggle.

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>But at the time, my rage felt like my only defense against the countless injustices I was forced to endure<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:injustices"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:injustices">1</a></sup> and the cruelty of a world out to keep me from feeling any real joy.</p>

<p>I was angry because it felt like things were out of my control. I was debris swept away in a flood — a helpless, hapless bystander caught in a cosmic battle that had nothing at all to do with me: the victim of cruel happenstance.</p>

<p><strong>The world was happening <em>to</em> me, and I felt helpless.</strong> So <em>of course</em> I was pissed; helplessness has got to be in the Top 5 for Reasons People Get Angry.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-logical-thought:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">Discovering Logical Thought</h2>

<p>Somewhere around fifteen or sixteen, my great-aunt sent me a copy of <a href="http://amzn.to/1T2FuaG"><em>The Fountainhead</em></a>, which started me down a philosophical rabbit-hole.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:aynrand"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:aynrand">2</a></sup> I read <a href="http://amzn.to/1eSrpPt"><em>Illusions</em></a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1MMo4jH"><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em></a>. I read generation-defining pop-philosophy in <a href="http://amzn.to/1IkeUXC"><em>Fight Club</em></a> and learned about the true nature of not giving a fuck in <a href="http://amzn.to/1KQ4Dq0"><em>Factotum</em></a> and realized I&rsquo;d never even come close to hitting bottom from <a href="http://amzn.to/1IGLrV4"><em>Jesus&rsquo; Son</em></a>.</p>

<p>This reading led to questions, which led to <a href="http://www.2FTAT.com">deep conversations with a friend</a>, which led to critical<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:non-critical"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:non-critical">3</a></sup> insights, and — finally — to actual changes in my behavior.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after a few minutes&rsquo; logical thought, I realized two things that drastically changed my life:</p>

<h3 id="1-no-one-is-out-to-get-me:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">1. No one is out to get me.</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s no dark force or diabolical villain working to make my life harder. It was hard to swallow, but I realized that <strong>I&rsquo;m just not that important.</strong> In fact, hardly anyone thinks about me <em>at all.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that I have critical importance and will therefore face critical opposition, but that&rsquo;s an extraordinarily myopic view of things.</p>

<p>The truth is that — while I am the most important person in <em>my</em> world — I barely register in the broader scope of <em>the</em> world.</p>

<p>Probably 95% of the human beings I pass on the street receive zero attention. Of the 5% I <em>do</em> notice, I only notice a single feature (&ldquo;Cool shoes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nice ass!&rdquo;) and they&rsquo;re forgotten the instant they leave my line of sight.</p>

<p>

<p>Who am I to think I&rsquo;m somehow deserving of everyone&rsquo;s attention when I barely give them any thought at all?</p>

<p>To roughly 7,348,999,994 of the 7,349,000,000 people on the planet, I either don&rsquo;t exist or don&rsquo;t matter enough to occupy short-term memory.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:peoplewhocare"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:peoplewhocare">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a target. I&rsquo;m not being singled out for cruelty.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m not a victim.</strong></p>

<h3 id="2-no-one-is-coming-to-save-me:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">2. No one is coming to save me.</h3>

<p>If my story has no villains, it&rsquo;s safe to assume there aren&rsquo;t any heroes, either.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, I&rsquo;m not a fragile, extraterrestrial secret weapon<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:fifthelement"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:fifthelement">5</a></sup> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tam">severely damaged government experiment on the run</a> — <strong>I&rsquo;m just a person.</strong> My interests are all fairly commonplace, my talents are all borderline commodities, and my opinions are the mutant, amalgamated offspring of the opinions of authors and mentors I&rsquo;ve paid attention to while I&rsquo;ve been alive.</p>

<p>The only unique thing about me is the <em>precise</em> arrangement of my interests, talents, actions, and opinions. Otherwise, everything I am, do, and believe is more or less standard-issue.</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s no need to save me; I&rsquo;m not vital to the future of our planet. <strong>No one is going to &ldquo;rescue me&rdquo; from my life.</strong> I won&rsquo;t be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner">discovered in a drug store</a> and propelled to stardom.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m on my own.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-empty-director-s-chair:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">The Empty Director&rsquo;s Chair</h2>

<p>On its face, this may sound bleak: I&rsquo;m all alone and no one cares.</p>

<p>But this is actually <em>great</em> news. It was probably the best news I&rsquo;d ever received as a teenager.</p>

<p>I spent most of my youth terrified of looking foolish. And when I wasn&rsquo;t worried about looking foolish, I was convinced that I would get in trouble if I made the wrong decision.</p>

<p><strong>When I realized no one gave a shit about me, life became immeasurably easier.</strong> I could strip down to one of those novelty thongs where my penis becomes an elephant trunk and sprint through a town hall meeting belting out the latest Taylor Swift single at the top of my lungs and <em>no one would care.</em></p>

<p>Sure, people would laugh, and someone would definitely put it on YouTube, but no one would <em>really</em> care. I&rsquo;d be a momentary amusement, and then I&rsquo;d fade right back into the anonymous social landscape.</p>

<p>This made it far easier to do things that were less ridiculous, like taking a chance on making it as a touring musician, or quitting my full-time job to give freelancing a shot.</p>

<p>My whole life, I&rsquo;d believed that <a href="https://medium.com/project-grownup/the-real-life-truman-show-1cd6b2aa9c34">people were watching me</a>, and that some unseen hand was shoving me along a path I had no control over.</p>

<p>But I was wrong: <strong>there was no one making decisions about my life.</strong> Except me, I guess — assuming I worked up the guts to make any decisions.</p>

<p>If my life was a movie, up until this point there&rsquo;d been no director. I&rsquo;d been carried along by the unstoppable current of time, but uncaptained, rudderless, drifting.</p>

<p>Unless I chose to act heroically, my movie had no hero. No villains unless I acted villainously. Unless I climbed in and took charge, the director&rsquo;s chair was — and would remain — empty.</p>

<p>After I assumed responsibility for my own life, everything changed.</p>

<p><strong>The world didn&rsquo;t happen <em>to</em> me anymore. <em>I happened to the world</em>.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:cheesy"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:cheesy">6</a></sup></p>

<p>I started steering myself away from the things that frustrated and depressed me, and toward things that excited and motivated me. It&rsquo;s been a long road, and I&rsquo;m still working on it today. I expect I&rsquo;ll probably still be working on it when I die.</p>

<p>I started seeing immediate improvement: my life was now my choice, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like a victim of anything. It wasn&rsquo;t pleasant to admit that a relationship ended because I acted like a dick, or that a project failed because I let everyone down and slacked, but <strong>making my own mistakes was <em>way</em> better than feeling helpless against the whims of a malevolent universe.</strong></p>

<h3 id="getting-in-my-own-way:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">Getting in My Own Way</h3>

<p>Comfortably at the helm of my personal narrative, I immediately started closing doors and adding restrictions.</p>

<p>What kind of man was I?</p>

<p>I was the type of man who didn&rsquo;t buy into bullshit corporate puppetry and advertising-driven entertainment.</p>

<p>I was the type of man who questioned all authority and made my own path.</p>

<p>I was the type of man who wouldn&rsquo;t be lumped in with a group or clique.</p>

<p>I, free thinker.</p>

<p>I, beacon of logical reasoning.</p>

<p>I, renegade individualist.</p>

<p>I, prisoner of silly, self-imposed roles.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-you:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">Who Are You?</h2>

<p>When I graduated high school, my parents took my whole family to Florida. It was half-intended as a graduation gift, and half-intended as a long-overdue family vacation. We went to Universal Studios and Disney World. Daytona Beach. Some enormous waterpark I can&rsquo;t remember the name of.</p>

<p>

  "As you've probably already guessed by my hairstyle, I hate everything. Especially you."

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p><strong>And I — bound by my staunch opposition to corporate profiteering, herd mentality, and enjoying anything popular — made sure I was miserable the whole time.</strong></p>

<p>It was hot and muggy in the way Florida is usually hot and muggy, but I wore long sleeves and black pants the whole time. While my brother and sister carried their tubes to the top of a big-ass whirlpool-looking deathtrap, I sulked in the shade.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:sulking"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:sulking">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The entire premise of my family&rsquo;s vacation violated my identity. It was an affront to the core of my being.</p>

<p>Except, of course, that my parents&rsquo; choice for a family vacation spot had exactly <em>nothing</em> to do with my identity, and <strong>I was really just letting some dude in a Mickey Mouse costume ruin family time simply by standing nearby.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of power to give a stranger wearing a giant rubber head.</p>

<h3 id="the-cages-we-build-for-ourselves:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">The Cages We Build for Ourselves</h3>

<p>Brick by brick, I&rsquo;d built a wall between what was and was not acceptable for Someone Like Me.</p>

<p>Someone Like Me listens to death metal.</p>

<p>Someone Like Me would <em>never</em> shop at Walmart.</p>

<p>Someone Like Me loves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_the_Homicidal_Maniac">Jhonen Vasquez</a>.</p>

<p>Someone Like Me doesn&rsquo;t love Jhonen Vasquez anymore because Hot Topic started carrying his comics.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:jthm"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:jthm">8</a></sup></p>

<p>I was proud of the wall at first, because it created a clear separation between &ldquo;us&rdquo; (me) and &ldquo;them&rdquo; (the sheeple).</p>

<p><strong>Building the wall was my tiny way of asserting a tiny bit of dominance over the tiny shadow I&rsquo;d cast on the Earth.</strong></p>

</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: a wall is a wall.</p>

<p>Before, I was trapped by the imaginary Malevolent Universe that ensured my life happened <em>to</em> me.</p>

<p><strong>Now, I was trapped by the imaginary Someone Like Me who ensured only a tiny subset of all available choices were ever seriously considered.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-identity-snowball:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">The Identity Snowball</h2>

<p>When I was born, I was a tiny spark of consciousness.</p>

<p>I had no memories. I knew nothing. All I cared about was whether I was hungry or sleepy.</p>

<p>When something happened, I had no frame of reference. I could only observe, consider it as an isolated event, and make a decision about what that meant to me in that moment.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:infantdecisions"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:infantdecisions">9</a></sup></p>

  No agenda, no prejudices — just a sweet bear sweater.

    
  </figcaption>

</p>

<p>There was no subtext or personal politics. <strong>Things were what they appeared to be. How could a thing be more than it is?</strong></p>

<p>As I grew, I learned language and fear and prejudice and opinion from my environment. Cat peed on me when I was four? Now I hate cats. Dog bit me? I&rsquo;m scared of Dalmatians.</p>

<p>My friends teased me about my Looney Tunes t-shirts, so that stuff was for babies. My mom knew the words to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc"><em>Tubthumping</em></a>, so it was clearly too mainstream for me to listen to.</p>

<p>The slow accumulation of experiential biases continued until <strong>I&rsquo;d become so mired in my identity that I could no longer see an event as A Thing That Happened</strong>; now it was inextricably linked to things I&rsquo;d seen or heard before, opinions I&rsquo;d adopted or developed, and my own historical stance on events of this type.</p>

<p>My tiny spark of consciousness had grown into a hulking snowball of opinions and filters and fears and prejudices, and it was growing larger every day. There was no such thing as an isolated incident anymore.</p>

<p><strong>I wasn&rsquo;t asking myself what I should do in response to an event; I was asking myself what Someone Like Me would do in response to that event.</strong></p>

<p>Yet again, I was out of the director&rsquo;s chair and letting something else make my decisions for me.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-melt-the-snowball:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">How to Melt the Snowball</h2>

<p>At 28, I was invited to try wake surfing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d always hated water: I nearly drowned on multiple occasions<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:drowning"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:drowning">10</a></sup> when I was really young; I had a chip on my shoulder about being too cool for sports (especially water sports); but mostly I was chubby, pasty, and generally uncomfortable in anything but long sleeves and pants.</p>

<p><strong>I made the decision to hate water before I can remember.</strong> As a result, I&rsquo;d spent nearly twenty years flatly refusing any activity involving water because — through the filter of my projected identity: Someone Like Me — water activities were stupid.</p>

<p>So my knee-jerk reaction was to refuse. Someone Like Me wouldn&rsquo;t do it, so of course I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>But then — at the insistence of my then-girlfriend — I started examining that refusal. Did I <em>really</em> dislike water sports, or was it just something I&rsquo;d told myself years ago and never since questioned? <strong>Was I cutting myself off from activities I might really enjoy because of something my idiot teenaged self had decided due to body issues and anti-conformity complexes?</strong></p>

<p>I decided to test it: I&rsquo;d go wake surfing, and if I hated it, my dislike for water sports was justified.</p>

<p>But if I liked it, <strong>I needed to reevaluate my opinions about the world.</strong></p>

<h3 id="taking-back-control-from-my-past-selves:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">Taking Back Control from My Past Selves</h3>

</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since learned how to surf, snorkel, and kayak.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:kinda"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a:kinda">11</a></sup> Each time, I was participating in water-based activities — the ones I&rsquo;d always told myself I hated — and each time, I had a blast.</p>

<p>How many other decisions was I letting my pre-teen self make? My teenage self? My twenty-two-year-old post-rockstar-aspirational self?</p>

<p>I had been cheating myself out of dozens — if not <em>hundreds</em> — of experiences because I&rsquo;d let my unexamined emotional detritus hobble me.</p>

<p><strong>Was I really in control of my life if a fifteen-year-old grudge against water was holding me back from things I truly enjoyed?</strong></p>

<h3 id="i-am-what-i-am:f2b86522572db70769126b5b2cb8ff8a">I Am What I Am</h3>

<p>In the aftermath of the wake surfing incident, I&rsquo;ve started running all my decisions through a do-I-really-feel-that-way-or-am-I-listening-to-my-idiot-teenaged-self-again filter.</p>

<p>I doubt I catch all of them. Good ideas still snag on my emotional barnacles more often than I&rsquo;d prefer.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m trying to keep my identity lean and adaptable. I&rsquo;ve got new <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Popeye">Popeye-esque mantra</a>, even:</p>

<p><strong>I am who I am — not who I was — and I&rsquo;m working to become who I want to be.</strong></p>

<p>So far, at least, I feel happier than I&rsquo;ve ever felt — and significantly more in-control of my life.</p>

<ul>
<li>A mother who forced the removal of a tongue ring, despite the fact that it cost a week&rsquo;s pay and several hours of subterfuge in order to get someone to do the piercing in the first place.</li>
<li>Girls who were mysteriously repelled by the black hair, zipper-and-safety-pin-laden clothing, death metal t-shirts, and generally shitty attitude of a <em>really nice guy</em> (which they&rsquo;d know, if they would stop being jerks and overlook all that so they could get to know him).</li>
<li>Internet commenters who couldn&rsquo;t seem to grasp that the Insane Clown Posse is just <em>terrible</em>, despite mountains of empirical evidence. Also, why were those idiot juggalos on the Eminem fan forum, anyways? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvmvxAcT_Yc">Fucking magnets</a>, right?</li>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
