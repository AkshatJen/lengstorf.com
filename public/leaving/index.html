        <p>I was eating leftovers over the sink with plastic silverware.</p>

<p>The previous morning, Marisa, her mother, and I had braved the line at Screen Door for one last Portland brunch. I finished the remnants of my chicken and waffles, doing my best to not to make a mess on the freshly-scrubbed counter and floor in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The apartment was completely empty. The cleaning service had left it sparkling. There was so much reverb when I spoke that it felt closer to an echo.</p>

<p>The giant living room I&rsquo;d loved so much was bare. I&rsquo;d taken the blanket and pillows we&rsquo;d slept on the night before out to the trash.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:donations">1</a></sup> Nicole from the cleaning service had taken nearly everything else — &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bill you for the hour I spent loading your stuff into my car,&rdquo; she texted me later.</p>

<p>Only two small suitcases, two backpacks, a box of last-minute chores, and a couple small trash cans remained.</p>

<p><em>This is everything I own,</em> I thought to myself.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption aligncenter">
  <img src="http://lengstorf.com/images/everything-i-own.jpg"
       alt="everything I own in two carry-on bags">
  <figcaption class="caption-text">

</figure>
</p>

<p>Marisa showed up around five thirty. We threw away the final few items from the fridge and tossed the trash — cans and all — into the compactor on the building&rsquo;s first floor.</p>

<p>We wheeled our luggage out of the apartment and I locked the door. I stopped by the manager&rsquo;s office. My heart was hurling itself against the walls of my ribcage, and I ran through the checklist for the hundred-thousandth time.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s all done. The apartment is empty. There&rsquo;s nothing left to forget.</em></p>

<p>I felt a little dizzy as I dropped the keys in the mail slot. They hit the bottom of the container on the other side with a nauseating finality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m officially homeless.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Ever since I started talking about <a href="http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/">my experiment in permanent travel</a> I&rsquo;ve been met with some variation on the question, &ldquo;Are you excited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reactions from my friends and family have ranged from excitement and good-natured jealousy to near-panic and quiet disapproval,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:disapproval"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:disapproval">2</a></sup> but — regardless of their view — everyone wants to know how I&rsquo;m feeling about the trip.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a question that feels like small talk. But as I went through the motions of responding — &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be a great adventure!&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ve heard amazing things about Italy!&rdquo; &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any pizza left by the time I leave!&rdquo; — pointed out something disconcerting to me as the kick-off date drew nearer: <em>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling excited.</em></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t nervous. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid. I wasn&rsquo;t second-guessing my decision.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; <em>anything.</em></p>

<p>Flight DAL418 to Milan was to me — as far as I was emotionally processing things — just another flight. My 59th of the year. Another 3,982 miles added to my SkyMiles balance.</p>

<p>The realization that I wasn&rsquo;t emotionally addressing this trip concerned me a little. Was I compartmentalizing too much? Was I bottling up my excitement and fear, wiring up an emotional booby trap that could detonate at at any moment? Was I in for a truly spectacular breakdown in JFK, collapsed in on myself in the Terminal 4 Starbucks, sobbing uncontrollably, feeling a year&rsquo;s worth of repressed feelings all at once?</p>

<hr />

<p>The night before the flight, I was restless.</p>

<p>All of the work was done. The tickets were purchased. All we had left to do was show up at the airport on time in the morning.</p>

<p>We ate our last meal in Portland at Robo Taco around nine. We ordered burritos and settled into a dimly lit corner. To my left, a muted television played PBS reruns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Marisa asked me between bites.</p>

<p>I was giddy. Nervous. Excited. Relieved that the work of severing my ties to Oregon was finally done. Happy that I&rsquo;d found a traveling partner. Scared that I was jumping with both feet into a world I don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This feels like the first day of school,&rdquo; I said. I was eating my burrito with a fork and knife because I&rsquo;d squeezed too hard and broken the tortilla, spilling the contents out the back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy and sad and excited and scared. It&rsquo;s that feeling of &lsquo;into the unknown&rsquo;, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<p>The conversation lulled as we finished eating, and we watched Bob Ross paint some happy little trees. Then we headed for the airport hotel.</p>

<hr />

<p>At four this morning, Marisa&rsquo;s alarm went off. She got up to shower, and I went back to sleep.</p>

<p>At ten to six we were in the security line. Six fifteen we were at the gate with coffee in hand. On the plane by seven.</p>

<p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean, getting further and further away from a home I no longer have. All of my former possessions are settling into new homes with the friends and strangers on Craigslist who bought them. The apartment I locked up last night has already been rented to new tenants; I imagine they&rsquo;ll start moving in this weekend.</p>

<p>Everything I own in the world is in two bags: one at my feet, and one above my head. I didn&rsquo;t leave behind a storage unit, or an attic-load of furniture for my parents to hold onto. <em>This is it.</em> These bags. The clothes I&rsquo;m wearing.</p>

<p>In a few hours I&rsquo;ll be in Milan, Italy, hauling my two bags into a stranger&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>I should be sleeping to ward off the imminent jet lag, but I&rsquo;m still restless. I can feel the weight of my eyelids, but I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the adventures that lie ahead — pizza! gelato! and I guess some old buildings and stuff<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:food"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:food">3</a></sup> — and the problems I haven&rsquo;t solved yet.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:97550d4b9bf5d0424943b399f8ecfa49:problems">4</a></sup></p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t feel as excited as is maybe appropriate. And I certainly don&rsquo;t feel as worried as my mom probably is.</p>

<p>But I feel a pressure building in my chest and throat that makes me want to either burst into laughter or tears. I feel proud that I have built a career that allows me to take this trip. I feel lucky to live in an age where technology allows a lifestyle like this to exist. I feel hopeful that my research and preparation will prove to be at least mostly correct.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how I should feel about all of this. But I&rsquo;m absolutely sure that I&rsquo;m ready for it.</p>

<p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
</p>
<p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>
        <div class="footer-about__copy">
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
