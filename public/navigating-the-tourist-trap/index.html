<p>In my worst nightmare it goes something like this:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m standing somewhere significant. Maybe historical, or cultural, or just <em>totally fucking majestic.</em> The sort of place your well-traveled friends tell you no but seriously you <em>have to see it.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of moment camera companies have trademarked. Before now the thing I&rsquo;m looking at was only an <em>understanding</em> of a place in my head, but now it&rsquo;s becoming an experience; a memory: the image from Wikipedia grows a Z axis and I can touch it and there&rsquo;s a smell and now I can give you directions to here complete with landmarks and everything.</p>

<p>I inhale deeply through my nose. <em>This is exactly the kind of shit that makes travel worthâ€”</em></p>

<p>My reverie is shattered by a tiny old woman in a sleeveless floral blouse and a white visor who elbows past me to take a photo of the &ldquo;Sortie / Exit, Toilettes / Washroom&rdquo; sign.</p>

<p>A British tour group forces me forward, each of them labeled with a neon Post-Itâ„¢ note signifying which bus brought them here. A middle-aged woman is digging in her purse in the middle of the path, preventing anyone from going around her, which has infuriated her husband up ahead to the point he&rsquo;s now standing in the middle of the path with his hands cupped around his mouth screaming <em>get out of the damn path, Emily, no one can get around you</em> as a queue builds on either side of him.</p>

<p>A Japanese kid is switching out absurdly expensive optics on his DSLR and taking macro shots of a fencepost, which doesn&rsquo;t bother me except that I know his photos of nothing are better than any photo I will take in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Behind me, a meaty shoulder or belly or breast presses into the back of my arm, and in front of me a child who is far too young to have any hope of remembering this family outing is <em>melting the fuck down</em> because he&rsquo;s the only one of us sane enough to realize that being here, on this path, in this place, is the worst kind of hell.</p>

<p>This gorgeous outdoor space starts to feel small, and the press of tourists is taking all of my oxygen. I suppress the urge to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Iv9q9QI1g">Barry Sanders</a> my way to the nearest exit.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I lived my nightmare.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon, I climb out the back of a van and into an enormous parking lot<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:village"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:village">1</a></sup> to join a queue of art- and/or flower-enthused travelers who&rsquo;ve made the trip to get a glimpse of Monet&rsquo;s botanical muses.</p>

<p>We enter through a small gate at the southwestern corner of the property. Inside the gate, there&rsquo;s a ticket booth and high hedges all around â€” no peeking, I guess. Marisa&rsquo;s mom bought some package online that lets us skip the line and duck through the hedge.</p>

<p>As weather for standing in a garden goes, this afternoon in Giverny is just about perfect. It&rsquo;s about 20Â°C under a bright blue sky with what Bob Ross would certainly describe as &ldquo;happy little clouds&rdquo; hovering over the Seine in the western sky.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>The garden is huge. Maybe a little bigger than a football field<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:pitch"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:pitch">2</a></sup> and crosshatched with paths that lead through intensely colorful landscaping that overflows with flowers I can&rsquo;t identify<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:flowers"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:flowers">3</a></sup> in colors I didn&rsquo;t know flowers could be.</p>

<p>Monet&rsquo;s garden is a special place. And not just because it was the inspiration for a large number of his paintings â€”Â this is a place where it just feels good to <em>be</em> for a while.</p>

<h3 id="and-the-locusts-descend:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">And the Locusts Descend&hellip;</h3>

<p>Yet, for all the beauty that the garden has to offer, there will be no peace or reflection here.</p>

<p>By my estimation, roughly 30% of the global population is stuffed inside the walls of Monet&rsquo;s garden, all jockeying for selfie-space along the garden paths.</p>

<p>Dozens of old women<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:oldwomen"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:oldwomen">4</a></sup> from every corner of the globe totter along the path, asking each other how their cameras work and (loudly) discussing the scene:</p>

<p><em>Aren&rsquo;t these gorgeous?</em></p>

<p><em>What?</em></p>

<p><em>The flowers!</em></p>

<p><em>The flowers?</em></p>

<p><em>Yes!</em></p>

<p><em>What about the flowers?</em></p>

<p><em>Aren&rsquo;t they gorgeous?</em></p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s gorgeous?</em></p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Teenage girls who&rsquo;ve slipped away from their parents make doe-eyes and duck-faces for strangers on Instagram.</p>

<p>A young couple detains me and holds up foot traffic so I can take their picture in front of the main path. Four times.</p>

<h3 id="sayeth-the-locust:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">&hellip;Sayeth the Locust</h3>

<p><em>I fucking hate tourists,</em> I think to myself as I crouch down in front of a flower that sort of looks like a popcorn ball to take a close-up with a shallow depth of field. Those tend to get more likes, I&rsquo;ve found.</p>

<p>I smile apologetically at the people waiting behind me as I usher Marisa and Jil into position for a mother-daughter photo. Marisa keeps talking, so I have to try three or four times before she&rsquo;s not pulling a goofy face in the photo.</p>

<p>When a baby bird I think is a black swan starts jumping from lily pad to lily pad, I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=839353302801239">take a video</a> and point it out to Jil and we discuss what type of bird it is. The ladies next to us start trying to take a video â€”Â <em>what button do I push again?</em> â€” and point it out to each other and start calling it a baby duck, which I decide is wrong and hold against them as ignorant Americans.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:bird"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:bird">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Marisa and I decide to skip Monet&rsquo;s house<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:house"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:house">6</a></sup> and duck outside the walls to buy ice cream. We find a spot in the shade to sit down and I silently judge all the other fatties on tour buses eating ice cream.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-tourist-traps:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">The Trouble with Tourist Traps</h2>

<p>I cringe at the thought of waiting three hours to ride <a href="https://www.londoneye.com/">the London Eye</a>. At <a href="http://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com/english/">Sacre-CÅ“ur</a>, I came as close as I&rsquo;ve ever been in adult life to starting a physical altercation with some overly-touchy peddler.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:touching"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:touching">7</a></sup></p>

<p>By default, I recoil from anything that would be called an &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; when I visit a new city.</p>

<p>The way I see it, these are the places that â€” once, long ago â€” had significance, but have now been roped off and sanitized and crammed full of souvenir shops to the point that, really, they&rsquo;re not anything like what they were when they became significant.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:edinburgh"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:edinburgh">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Anything with any value to a city&rsquo;s tourism board quickly becomes the Attraction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">of Theseus</a>: if an historically significant site, incrementally, has all its parts replaced by informational plaques and concession stands, is it still the same historically significant site?</p>

<h3 id="and-yet:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">And Yet&hellip;</h3>

<p>Despite the issues with tourist traps, there&rsquo;s no denying that some of this stuff really does have historical significance. And really â€” significance aside â€” some of it is just <em>really fucking cool</em> to see up close.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower is probably one of the top 5 most recognizable structures in the world. Almost everyone can sketch a rough approximation of what it looks like.</p>

<p>But, goddammit, standing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerelle_Debilly">Passerelle Debilly</a> facing SSE at 23:00 is still breathtaking, no matter how many times I&rsquo;ve seen the photos online before.</p>

<p>So for all the venom and vitriol I spit at tourist attractions, I&rsquo;m still susceptible to the sense of wonder and awe that made these places attractions in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-better-mouse-trap:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">Building a Better Mouse Trap</h2>

<p>On Tuesday, back in Monet&rsquo;s garden, I started solving problems in my head.</p>

<p><em>These paths should be made one-way to avoid this clusterfuck.</em></p>

<p><em>Why are half the paths closed?</em></p>

<p><em>They should let us pay more for a ticket where only 25 people get to go in at a time.</em></p>

<p>My claustrophobia and impatience grew in intensity, and my solutions became more extreme.</p>

<p><em>You should have to pass a basic camera competence exam to get into this place.</em></p>

<p><em>Everyone should be allowed three photos before moving further down the path.</em></p>

<p>By the end I was more or less a Marvel supervillain:</p>

<p><em>Humanity has failed to make tourism work. To fix tourism, we must kill all tourists.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:exceptions"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:exceptions">9</a></sup> This is the only way.</em></p>

</p>

<h2 id="coming-to-terms-with-tourism:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">Coming to Terms with Tourism</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;m here, standing on a bridge over the world&rsquo;s most famous waterlilies, fuming over the crowds and the chaos and the commercialization of history. I feel cheated because I can&rsquo;t <em>truly</em> enjoy this experience with all these other jerks pushing their way past me.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy of it all sneaks up on me. I feel a little sick.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m one of them.</em></p>

<p>I came here to look at this place. To take iPhone photos and tell my Facebook friends I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m probably less qualified than many of these people: they might be able to name a few Monet paintings â€” maybe they know more about this painter and his garden than his first name. Really I just came because Jil wanted to go and I wanted to make an effort and keep an open mind.</p>

<p>But really, at the core, I&rsquo;m only one Tommy Bahama button-down removed from the guy next to me. We&rsquo;re both foreigners. We both speak no French and have bad American habits and probably offend<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:offense"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:offense">10</a></sup> nearly half the locals we meet. We wanted to see the best things the world has to offer, and this particular piece of the globe has been deemed noteworthy â€” so here we are.</p>

<h3 id="we-re-not-so-different-you-and-i:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">We&rsquo;re Not So Different, You and I&hellip;</h3>

<p>My self-consciousness about being an outsider makes me quick to put some distance between myself and tourists. I don&rsquo;t want French people to look at me and immediately peg me as an American<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:american"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:american">11</a></sup> and assume I&rsquo;m just some tourist.</p>

<p>More importantly, I don&rsquo;t want to <em>be</em> just some tourist.</p>

<p>So, sure, maybe the people in this garden with me will spend their vacations eating burgers because <em>coq au vin</em> sounds too exotic, and maybe they&rsquo;ll never leave Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es unless it&rsquo;s in the back of a tour van. Maybe they won&rsquo;t even bother trying to speak French.</p>

<p>None of that makes me better than they are.</p>

<p>When I sit next to an American couple and pretend not to speak English so I don&rsquo;t have to talk to them, that&rsquo;s not making me <em>more</em> worldly; it&rsquo;s further isolating me.</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-authenticity:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">In Search of Authenticity</h2>

<p>I want to &ldquo;live like a local&rdquo; â€” it&rsquo;s been this <a href="http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/">location independence experiment&rsquo;s</a> <em>raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:french"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:french">12</a></sup> from the start â€” but my eagerness to have an &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; experience built a wall between me and other travelers.</p>

<p>I want to be seen as The Right Kind of Travelerâ„¢: when I meet someone from another country, I want to become the example they offer up as an exception to the rule during a discussion of how awful American tourists are.</p>

<p>But if I let my desire to live as locally as someone can for a month become a default avoidance of anything that could be called &ldquo;tourist activities&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll miss out on a huge percentage of the world&rsquo;s beauty and history.</p>

<p>Just because it&rsquo;s popular doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not worth doing.</p>

<h2 id="authentic-tourism:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b">Authentic Tourism</h2>

<p>Outside Monet&rsquo;s garden, Jil asks me, &ldquo;Did you have a good time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our ride home is pulling into the parking lot, near the bench where we were all told to meet at 14:30. We hurry to polish off our ice cream cones and buy a bottled water for the drive. The older couple we rode up with looks exhausted â€” &ldquo;&hellip;can&rsquo;t wait to get to Provence so we can finally slow down and relax,&rdquo; the man is saying to his wife, who is flipping through the photos she&rsquo;s taken today.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption aligncenter">

</p>

<p>Jil lives for this stuff: tomorrow she&rsquo;ll be waiting outside a comfortable hotel in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at 05:30 for a bus tour to Normandie in the morning, back in the late afternoon to haul ass to MusÃ©e d&rsquo;Orsay before closing, off to the Eiffel Tower to see it sparkle at 23:00 on the dot, and in bed right away so she can get up at 04:00 to do it all again the next day.</p>

<p>I get exhausted just <em>reading</em> her itinerary.</p>

<p>But I can see on her face that this â€” standing on the bridge Claude Monet painted in 1899 â€”Â this is a <em>moment</em> for her. Walking through Monet&rsquo;s house, she could feel Monet in those rooms; she was sharing space with one of her favorite artists.</p>

<p>The meaning â€” the emotion â€” that this trip held for her was beyond anything I could ever hope to feel about a house or a garden.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t hold that against her. I can&rsquo;t hold that against any one of these people here to see something significant from human history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was great, Jil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiles and thanks me for putting up with the crowds. Then she asks if I want to go to Normandy tomorrow at 05:30. (I don&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ll go to Versailles<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:versailles"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:929df55f9a9feba66dd2b2aa3d52f22b:versailles">13</a></sup> the day after. And then we&rsquo;ll go to a local bar I like where we&rsquo;re the only people who don&rsquo;t speak French. Because I don&rsquo;t have to choose: I can be a tourist sometimes without ruining my chances at experiencing local hangouts.</p>

<p>So, quick: take my picture in front of this moment. I want all my friends to know I had a like <em>life-changing epiphany</em> in Paris.</p>

<p>That shit gets retweeted like crazy.</p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
