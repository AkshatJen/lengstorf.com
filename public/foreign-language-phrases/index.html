<p>I started out feeling pretty cocky. I usually do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak a little Spanish. How hard could Italian really be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The airport was easy; everyone spoke English. The train, too. Our taxi driver didn&rsquo;t speak much English, but all he really needed was an address, anyways.</p>

<p>This was promising: three interactions with Italians and no issues!</p>

<p>The cab driver dropped us at Ripa&rsquo;s Cafe, where our Airbnb host, Francesco, had left the keys to his apartment. I felt bulletproof as I wheeled my carry-on into the bar and approached the counter.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Prego?&rdquo;</em> The man behind the counter was in a hurry, and folks from the neighborhood were queueing up behind me for lottery tickets and cigarettes.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth, froze, and slowly closed it again.</p>

<p><em>Fuck. I don&rsquo;t speak Italian. I don&rsquo;t know how to say &ldquo;keys&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>I was tongue-tied. I didn&rsquo;t even know how to tell this poor guy I didn&rsquo;t speak Italian. My cocksure attitude toward the language barrier withered, and I knew I was defeated.</p>

<p>And so — my cheeks burning bright red in embarrassment — I waved the white flag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head and walked away. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was coming back. Were we supposed to wait?</p>

<p>I felt the people behind me staring daggers into the back of my head. My body was tying itself in knots. I was shrinking in shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can help, please?&rdquo; A girl had appeared behind the counter, looking at Marisa and I with pity. She barely spoke any English, but with a lot of miming and hand gestures we were able to get the keys.</p>

<p>Once we finally found the apartment, I felt sick and helpless as I collapsed on the bed.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m in <strong>way</strong> over my head,</em> I thought.</p>

</p>

<p>After I came to grips with the fact I wasn&rsquo;t able to learn Italian by magic and/or wishing <em>really</em> hard, I did two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I downloaded <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> and started the Spanish course.</li>
<li>I made a list of phrases that I knew I would use multiple times each day.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I had to figure out how to get by without speaking the language.</strong></p>

<p>I needed a way to acknowledge people when spoken to. I was going to need to ask for things like food and coffee. I knew people would help me, and I needed to know how thank them.</p>

<p>My emergency phrase list was born.</p>

<p>There was no avoiding it, really; I&rsquo;m a terrible mime.</p>

<h2 id="know-enough-to-get-by:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Know Enough to Get By</h2>

<p>For a short trip — for instance, five days in Milan — there&rsquo;s very little chance I&rsquo;ll <em>really</em> learn the language. So instead, I choose to <strong>focus on the words and phrases that meet the minimum requirements for functioning in that country.</strong></p>

<p>So far, these are the phrases I&rsquo;ve gotten the most mileage out of. You won&rsquo;t impress the locals with your conversational skills. You&rsquo;ll still be lost in most conversations.</p>

<p>But knowing these few key phrases will at least give you tools to feel a little less helpless.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-learn-how-to-apologize:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Step 1: Learn How to Apologize</h2>

<p>

<figure class="caption alignright">
  <img src="http://lengstorf.com/images/im-sorry.jpg"
       alt="I&#39;m sorry">
  <figcaption class="caption-text">
    

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>It might not get much done, but if you learn <em>nothing else</em> of a foreign language, at least <strong>learn how to apologize for showing up in someone else&rsquo;s country and not speaking their language.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s usually just two phrases: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; and &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="i-m-sorry-i-don-t-speak-your-language:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">I&rsquo;m Sorry, I Don&rsquo;t Speak Your Language</h3>

<p>After the debacle in Milan, this is the first phrase I will learn in every language. I&rsquo;ll know it before I enter the country, and I&rsquo;ll have practiced it under my breath repeatedly as I deplane.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not particularly useful in the practical sense. It won&rsquo;t help anyone understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say. In fact, after I&rsquo;ve said it, I&rsquo;ll be exactly where I was before I said it.</p>

<p>With one key difference.</p>

<p>One <em>huge</em> key difference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve let the person I&rsquo;m speaking to know that — if nothing else — <strong>I cared enough to learn how to let them know I&rsquo;m a dumbshit tourist who can&rsquo;t speak their language.</strong> I put in a tiny bit of effort to show respect, even if it won&rsquo;t help us communicate any better.</p>

<p>And what I&rsquo;ve seen, after trying this in both Italy and Spain so far, is that it totally transforms my interactions.</p>

<p>When I said nothing and gaped helplessly at the waitress, the situation was a stand-off: an exasperated waitress stares into my wide, uncomprehending eyes with a look of annoyance.</p>

<p>By making the effort and letting her know I don&rsquo;t understand her, it becomes a relatively painless situation: she smiles and says something I don&rsquo;t understand,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:waitress"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:waitress">1</a></sup> then calls to the back for the dishwasher, who speaks English, and we&rsquo;re able to place our order.</p>

<p>Of course, my goal is to learn how to order in the local language as quickly as possible to avoid the need for a translator altogether. In the time before I learn how, this is the best solution I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why I think this is so effective: <strong>by making an effort to learn a bit of the local language, I&rsquo;m helping avoid the perception that I&rsquo;m an asshole tourist who sees the people in the country I&rsquo;m visiting as less important than I am.</strong> Instead, I&rsquo;m a newcomer who&rsquo;s trying to learn, but hasn&rsquo;t gotten it all figured out yet.</p>

<p>People like to help each other when it feels like teamwork, or when they see someone struggling to figure something out. A few of the people we&rsquo;ve interacted with have actually taken extra time to help us translate menus, and it felt like they were genuinely pleased to have helped us learn something.</p>

<p>

  Dad Spanish: "I WOULD LIKE EL STEAK-O!"

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I sit down and immediately start ordering in Dad Spanish, I&rsquo;ve just shown that I&rsquo;m willing to make zero effort, but I expect a big effort and a lot of help from the person I&rsquo;m talking to. This is disrespectful, and it puts me at odds with the person I&rsquo;m dealing with — hardly a productive way to handle a situation where I need help.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an enormous benefit for very little effort. For example, in Spanish, all you have to say is, <em>&ldquo;Lo siento, no hablo español.&rdquo;</em> (I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish.)</p>

<h3 id="excuse-me:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Excuse Me</h3>

<p>When I&rsquo;m walking down the street — especially in more heavily touristed areas — I&rsquo;m inevitably going to bump into people.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pedestrians"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pedestrians">2</a></sup> Rather than staring at them wide-eyed or saying something they won&rsquo;t understand, I <strong>learn how to say a polite &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo; in their language,</strong> which shows respect — I&rsquo;m speaking their language — and avoids misunderstanding — they may not get my meaning when I say, &ldquo;Sorry &lsquo;bout that, pal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Romance languages, these are often pretty similar to the English words you already know. For example, in Italian you would say, <em>&ldquo;Scuzi!&rdquo;</em> In Spanish, <em>&ldquo;Perdón!&rdquo;</em> French: <em>&ldquo;Excusez-moi.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This also helps politely get someone&rsquo;s attention, making it doubly useful to learn right away.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-mind-your-manners:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Step 2: Mind Your Manners</h2>

<p>If I&rsquo;m going to be an idiot, I&rsquo;m at least going to be a polite idiot. <strong>Figuring out the basics of being polite makes every interaction more friendly.</strong> This, I hope, slightly eases the imminent pain<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pain"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:pain">3</a></sup> and frustration I&rsquo;m about to cause the person I&rsquo;m speaking to.</p>

<h3 id="please-thank-you:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Please &amp; Thank You</h3>

<p>This is all you need. Learn them, and use them often.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re American and headed to a Spanish-speaking country, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ve heard these before: <em>por favor</em> (please) and <em>gracias</em> (thank you).</p>

<h2 id="step-3-learn-how-to-feed-yourself:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Step 3: Learn How to Feed Yourself</h2>

<p>I love food.</p>

<p>I also need food. Y&rsquo;know, to stay alive.</p>

<p>For me, my ability to locate good food makes the difference between having a good time and being utterly miserable, so <strong>I place a high priority on learning my way around local menus.</strong></p>

<p>This is all very good news to me; I love both ham <em>and</em> cheese.</p>

<p>What I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> seen consistently on menus is much of anything else. Turkey, beef, or chicken are available <em>sometimes,</em> but not with anywhere near the ubiquity of good ol&rsquo; ham and cheese.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:vegetarians"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:vegetarians">4</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>My strategy to ensure I&rsquo;ll always be able to find something to eat is to figure out how to translate &ldquo;ham and cheese&rdquo; and then pick items off the menu that feature those words.</strong></p>

<p>When I can&rsquo;t understand any of the language on a menu, this is my food security blanket: by ordering ham and cheese, there&rsquo;s a better-than-50% chance I&rsquo;ve just ordered either a sandwich or an omelet, and both are fine by me.</p>

<p>I do my best to figure out more as quickly as possible so I can sample the variety of foods each city has to offer, but by starting out with ham and cheese I can at least be sure I don&rsquo;t accidentally order an artichoke and tripe soup for breakfast.</p>

</p>

<p>Ordering coffee is easy in almost any language — if you see an espresso machine and say &ldquo;cafe&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll probably get the point across effectively. The trick, though, is to <strong>learn the way to order coffee in each language so it comes the way you prefer.</strong></p>

<p>I like my coffee with a little milk, which means I need to figure out what it&rsquo;s called locally. In Italy, this is easy (assuming any amount of time spent in or near an American coffee shop): <em>cappuccino.</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:cappuccino"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:cappuccino">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In Spanish, it&rsquo;s not quite as easy — the terminology isn&rsquo;t used in American cafes. <em>Café con leche</em> (coffee with milk) is a rough equivalent to the Italian cappuccino, and the <em>café cortado</em> is a rough equivalent of the <em>macchiato</em> (a shot of espresso with just a dollop of steamed milk and foam).</p>

<p>To some this may not seem like a big deal; to me, this is a non-negotiable entry in my emergency phrasebook.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-don-t-like:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Things I Don&rsquo;t Like</h3>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m not a picky eater, it&rsquo;s far easier for me to <strong>figure out which food items I&rsquo;d like to avoid</strong> than to learn all the things I might enjoy.</p>

<p>My list of dislikes is very short: I don&rsquo;t want to order fish unless I&rsquo;m in a restaurant that specializes in fish, and if I&rsquo;m given a choice I&rsquo;ll take the option without spinach or kale.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:spinach"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f:spinach">6</a></sup></p>

<p>So I learn those words and pick around them on a menu.</p>

<p>By knowing what I want to avoid, it&rsquo;s far less frightening to pick something I&rsquo;ve never tried off the menu. This allows me to be more adventurous in my food choices without running the risk of ordering something I know <em>for sure</em> I&rsquo;d rather not eat.</p>

<h3 id="ask-for-the-bill:ac39e985d127e502f9040ce466dd019f">Ask for the Bill</h3>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve noticed in restaurants is that no one will bring you the bill until you ask for it.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption alignleft">

  Paying for things is harder than you might think.

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s out of politeness or something else, but after the waiter clears our plates and confirms that we don&rsquo;t want anything else — if we forget to ask for the bill — we&rsquo;ll spend the next fifteen minutes trying to catch his eye again so we can pay and leave.</p>

<p>This proved extremely frustrating when I didn&rsquo;t know how to ask for it. After I got sick of waving my credit card at people, I figured I should add this to my must-learn phrases in every language.</p>

<p>In Spain, when the waiter comes to clear our plates and asks if we want anything else, I decline politely and ask, <em>&ldquo;¿La cuenta, por favor?&rdquo;</em> (The check, please?)</p>

  If you&rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t start living this life sooner.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
