&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I love a good cup of coffee, and that my first order of business upon arriving in a new city is to locate the best barista in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good coffee is important to me.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:marco-arment&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:marco-arment&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wallywhitefish.com/&#34;&gt;My dad&lt;/a&gt;, however, doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a shit about coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves a good cup every now and then, but most of the time he drinks &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keurig.com/shop/k-cups/all-k-cups&#34;&gt;K-cup coffee&lt;/a&gt; or — gasp! — instant Folgers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fighting-the-urge-to-fix-my-dad-s-taste-in-coffee:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540&#34;&gt;Fighting the Urge to &amp;ldquo;Fix&amp;rdquo; My Dad&amp;rsquo;s Taste in Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: my preference in coffee only matters to me. His preference in coffee only matters to him. And the little bit of overlap when he drinks &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heartroasters.com/&#34;&gt;my kind of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, or when I drink his, just isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the emotional effort of caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I call my dad&amp;rsquo;s preferences into question, it puts strain on both of us. He&amp;rsquo;s defensive because I&amp;rsquo;m attacking something he&amp;rsquo;s doing; I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated because he can&amp;rsquo;t see how unbelievably, unflinchingly &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; I am; both of us start thinking of excuses to leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-could-you-possibly-like-that:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540&#34;&gt;How Could You &lt;em&gt;Possibly&lt;/em&gt; Like That?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose sight of what&amp;rsquo;s really important in relationships. We all have a tendency to get caught up in a little cloud of &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; that makes opposing viewpoints seem scary, stupid, irresponsible, ignorant, or any combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the majority of the decisions I make have zero impact on the people closest to me. If I&amp;rsquo;m not into &lt;em&gt;Parks &amp;amp; Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any difference&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:mustache&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:mustache&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for my friends who love that show; if I don&amp;rsquo;t see the appeal of running a marathon, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything at all for the people who embrace the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the opposite is true: my friends&amp;rsquo; decisions don&amp;rsquo;t actually impact me. Yes, I would love it if all of my friends loved whisky and talking about business development. That some of them don&amp;rsquo;t means nothing within the scope of my experience; I can still enjoy whisky, even if Chelle prefers tequila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting worked up because things that don&amp;rsquo;t affect me aren&amp;rsquo;t done my way is a shortcut to an extremely frustrating and deeply dissatisfying existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-want-to-know-how-to-solve-all-your-problems-just-be-a-little-less-like-you-and-a-lot-more-like-me-attribution:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;You want to know how to solve all your problems? Just be a little less like you, and a lot more like me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:attribution&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:attribution&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to start a lot of monologues with the phrase, &amp;ldquo;You know what you should do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d listen — for a few seconds, at least — to someone&amp;rsquo;s experience, apply my own tastes to it, then harangue them about all the ways they were doing it wrong. In effect, all I was saying was, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you even &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how much easier your life would be if you were just *more like me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I always hated in other people: they&amp;rsquo;d just start telling me how to solve problems that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was ignoring, though, is that I&amp;rsquo;m just as annoying when I force my taste onto others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My taste doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. At least not to anyone but me. (And neither does yours.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-shut-up-and-drink-the-shitty-coffee:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540&#34;&gt;Just Shut Up and Drink the Shitty Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could get offended by my dad&amp;rsquo;s ambivalence toward a subject I&amp;rsquo;m so passionate about. I could try to convince him that he&amp;rsquo;s wrong, and that his decision to drink awful coffee is somehow linked to his happiness and overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I visit my parents and my dad serves me K-cup coffee, I could throw a fit and refuse to drink it. Or I could bring coffee with me and supplant his morning coffee ritual with my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I drink coffee with my dad. Because as long as I&amp;rsquo;m spending time with people I love, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the coffee is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:marco-arment&#34;&gt;I spun off on a tangent and wrote this article after reading Marco Arment&amp;rsquo;s article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marco.org/2014/03/31/throwing-k-cups-in-glass-houses&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throwing K-Cups In Glass Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:mustache&#34;&gt;Except that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand half the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwGat4i8pJI&#34;&gt;Ron Swanson&lt;/a&gt; jokes they make about my mustache.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:d2da049ed3145702cc6f7c305092b540:attribution&#34;&gt;I wish I could take credit for this little gem, but it comes from a friend of mine. I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to get attributed to him as something said seriously, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to include his name here.
