      <description>&lt;p&gt;Or, the measures Iâ€™m taking to avoid sinking into the trap of dying frustrated and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things about writing is just sitting down to write. I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling myself that I&amp;rsquo;d get around to blogging again for&amp;hellip;three years, now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like writing. I think thoughts that I find helpful. I believe that some of those thoughts &amp;ndash; in theory, at least &amp;ndash; are valuable when applied by humans other than myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the silence, then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lack of desire, certainly. At least once a day it occurs to me that something I&amp;rsquo;ve said or done or learned or screwed up could be worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not fear. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly long to spill my guts publicly, but I&amp;rsquo;m far from shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My literary cease-fire, then, boils down to either inertia or screwy priorities. Probably, if I&amp;rsquo;m being completely honest, a fair amount of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, or just my own unwillingness to spend an extended amount of time alone with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a trend right now in the circles I run in: more and more people around me are meditating or keeping gratitude journals or something similarly, inwardly peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not me, though. I can&amp;rsquo;t do it; meditation feels forced and awkward, and a gratitude journal is just homework from a lifestyle blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though my knee-jerk reaction is to write it all off as new agey, touchy-feeley, hippie dippy bullshit, I see the value in it. We need to be alone with our thoughts; to spend some time sifting through all the noise in our minds; to think a little bit about the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of what we&amp;rsquo;re feeling instead of just the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s next&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s some pretty important, grownup-level business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves me with a bit of a conundrum: I feel like an asshole counting my breaths or keeping a diary of warm fuzzies, but I see a valid and pressing need to stay mindful of where I am, what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m here to learn. If I&amp;rsquo;m not learning from the things I feel, I&amp;rsquo;m just barreling toward death as a ball of unexamined loneliness, momentary joy, and mystery boners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes sense to me is to just take half an hour each day and write. No set subject matter, no agenda, no business model &amp;ndash; just a (completely public) space to spend a little alone time with the chaos in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really, this may just prove to be my way of both meditating &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; keeping a gratitude journal, tweaked just enough that I can convince myself it&amp;rsquo;s neither.&lt;/p&gt;
