&lt;p&gt;A little while back, I got an email from an anonymous email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy — let&amp;rsquo;s call him &amp;ldquo;John&amp;rdquo; — had a lot of questions about how I was actually making my lifestyle work. Never mind the travel tips, he said, I want to know how you &lt;em&gt;make money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked John if he&amp;rsquo;d be willing to get on a call with me and let me record our conversation. He agreed, and we talked for about 50 minutes. John grilled me on how I got started, how long it took me to break even, and how I keep things moving now that I&amp;rsquo;m half a world away from the people I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/206033656&amp;color=e26700&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The audio ends rather abruptly; John wanted to ask a couple questions off the record (that were very specific to his own situation), so I cut the audio off there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve summarized what we talked about on the call. John&amp;rsquo;s questions are the headlines, and my (heavily paraphrased) responses are the text in each section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-actual-nature-of-the-work-you-re-doing:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Is the Actual Nature of the Work You&amp;rsquo;re Doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I work as a freelance web developer, but I have a single long-term contract with one client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day-to-day tasks center around software research and development: I build experimental apps quickly to test new ideas (kind of a one-man &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project&#34;&gt;skunkworks&lt;/a&gt;). I try out something crazy on a small alpha audience, and if it proves viable, the project is handed off to the production team as a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project with dedicated resources and so on.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-to-the-point-of-feeling-established:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get to the Point of Feeling &amp;ldquo;Established&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a year and a half of going full-time freelance, I was able to make about $30K/year. For me, who had no family, debt, or much overhead at all, was more than enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-started:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get Started?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got interested in web design when I was playing in a band. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to hire help, so I volunteered myself to do design when we needed it. It stayed interesting, so I kept learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the band broke up, I was still interested in web design. I built a website for a close friend of mine, which led to leads for a couple local websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those leads gave me the opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/&#34;&gt;quit my day job and freelance full-time&lt;/a&gt;. I took the plunge, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been my own boss ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-your-business-grew-organically:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;So Your Business Grew Organically?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I had to take work wherever I could find it, and I spent a lot of time chasing leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, though, I started to get emails from people asking about websites. Most of them were health and fitness professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my work for Nate — the first website I ever built that wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me — and due largely in part to Nate&amp;rsquo;s incredible success in the health and fitness sector as a journalist, I was introduced to a few up-and-coming fitness pros who needed websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built sites for John Romaniello, Tony Gentilcore, and Mike Robertson. They all had (or would soon have) enormous online presence, and their recommendations carried a lot of weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys were rising stars in the industry. They were speaking at conferences, writing articles, getting interviewed in major publications — they were the connectors, to put it into &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point#The_three_rules&#34;&gt;Gladwellian terms&lt;/a&gt;. Other people looking to make it as fitness pros asked my clients for advice, and when it came to web design, my name was dropped frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned into a very strong referral network that became effective enough over time that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go looking for clients anymore; I had 3–5 new leads coming to me each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become &amp;ldquo;the guy for that&amp;rdquo; — this has been the ultimate secret to my success. I have become dependably excellent in my area of expertise: my clients could trust me to solve their problems effectively without requiring much of their time. That trust led them to continue working with me and referring me to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-long-did-it-take-before-you-felt-comfortable:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Long Did It Take Before You Felt Comfortable?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about a year and a half to get to the point where I was making $30K/year. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything extravagant, but I was able to live comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealing-with-dry-months:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Dealing with Dry Months&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things were rough for me, starting out, was when I had a slow month. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think ahead and put money aside when I had good months, so the dry months were rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have solved that problem fast, had I been a little smarter about things, and it would have made me far more stable as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was dumb, so I&amp;rsquo;d have a good month and — instead of putting it away to cover a slow month later — I&amp;rsquo;d say, &amp;ldquo;Fuck yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s go to Hawaii!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-gain-the-technical-competency-to-get-where-you-are-now:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Gain the Technical Competency to Get Where You Are Now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really curious about how things work, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s probably the single biggest advantage I have in life.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being generally curious, I also had a need: my band needed a website if we were going to tour effectively, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I learned to customize a MySpace page. Then I built a crappy website after a shitload of Googling. I built it again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would come up against a problem that we needed to solve, and then I would find a way to solve it. It was fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hubris-of-being-19:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;The Hubris of Being 19&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious about how to make more powerful tools, and I needed to find a way to let my clients update their own websites without requiring me to go in and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of the open source community at this time, or of WordPress. Plus, I was a cocky teenager who thought I could build something better than anything else that was out there — so I built a CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a terrible business plan, but an excellent learning tool. As a result I understand a lot of what happens behind the scenes in a tool like WordPress or Ghost, and when those tools don&amp;rsquo;t do what I need them to do, I can usually figure out a way to build something new to solve my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-get-marketing-skills-in-combination-with-the-tech-skills:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Did You Get Marketing Skills in Combination with the Tech Skills?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have this delusional belief that — if I continue to study — eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll understand everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of my clients work in the same industry, I saw them all running up against the same kinds of problems. I also saw what was working for my more successful clients, and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the clients who were struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I love learning how things work, I started to dig into the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of it all. I saw patterns emerging, and I learned how to apply what I learned to new clients in a way that helped them grow their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had marketing experience out of the necessity of being a broke musician. I had to figure out a way to convince high school kids to come pay $5 to watch a band they&amp;rsquo;d never heard of before from Montana — it was a good primer on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, on bigger projects, I&amp;rsquo;d hire experts to come in and set up complicated marketing efforts, and I&amp;rsquo;d watch what they did and keep asking why they were doing it. So even when I didn&amp;rsquo;t do the work myself, I tried to continue learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-would-you-design-your-own-curriculum-for-getting-a-skill-set:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Would You Design Your Own Curriculum for Getting a Skill Set?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical side is the biggest job pool, but you can find non-technical jobs as well: customer support, executive assistants, writers, accountants, lawyers — the world is set up to make most knowledge work possible remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go the tech route, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to figure out how you learn best: some people get the most out of reading tutorials and documentation; others have better luck with video instruction like &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;; and then there&amp;rsquo;s always something to be said for learning in an in-person, hands-on environment.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hands-on training, there are a lot of new bootcamps popping up all over. In Portland, for example, you can take a four-month course through &lt;a href=&#34;http://epicodus.com&#34;&gt;Epicodus&lt;/a&gt; that guarantees real-world job experience through an internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-technical careers, start looking for jobs on the many job boards out there, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://remoteok.io/&#34;&gt;remoteok.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://weworkremotely.com/&#34;&gt;weworkremotely.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wfh.io/&#34;&gt;wfh.io&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the listings are for tech jobs, but there are a good number of support, content, marketing, and human resources jobs posted as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-hurdles:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Are the Hurdles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily the biggest hurdle to making it as a freelancer is your own temperament. Are you excited about your work and eager to get tasks knocked out? Or are you more likely to need someone cracking the whip over you before you&amp;rsquo;ll get things done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Further reading: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/scheduling-maximum-productivity/&#34;&gt;Get More Done Faster — Scheduling for Maximum Productivity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;breaking-into-the-industry:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Breaking into the Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep doing projects in the industry. If you have to start out doing free work, do it. But try to get paid every time — you&amp;rsquo;re providing a service, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to learn cars, I&amp;rsquo;d buy books, hang out with my more mechanically inclined friends, bother my mechanic with questions about what he was doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d start with small projects: changing my own oil or changing the tires. Then I&amp;rsquo;d graduate up to more difficult tasks — my ultimate aim would be to know enough to take the car apart and put it back together again, and I&amp;rsquo;d get there one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a project that&amp;rsquo;s about 10% above your skill level and take it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/&#34;&gt;Set yourself on fire&lt;/a&gt; to learn the new skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 10% beyond your skill set, there&amp;rsquo;s very little risk that you&amp;rsquo;ll be unable to figure it out; where the risk comes in is if you get too ambitious and do something that requires learning several layers of skills to complete — taking a job as a lifeguard before you&amp;rsquo;ve learned to swim, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a balance between challenging and &amp;ldquo;in way over my head&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-mutually-intelligible-are-programming-languages:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Mutually Intelligible Are Programming Languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages share ideas. JavaScript and PHP have different syntax, but a lot of the concepts carry through. Each programming language is usually created by taking a programmer&amp;rsquo;s idea of the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; features of any number of existing programming languages, and adding or removing features as they see fit.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to build the mental models at first, which is the hard part. After that you&amp;rsquo;ll start to see patterns emerge. It starts out feeling like total nonsense, but similarities show up, and concepts cross languages. You&amp;rsquo;ll find that each new language you learn takes a lot less time than the one before it did.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-you-see-in-the-future-and-how-are-you-positioning-yourself-what-s-your-relationship-with-new-tools:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Do You See in the Future, and How Are You Positioning Yourself? What&amp;rsquo;s Your Relationship with New Tools?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to find a balance between using tools that solve problems (WordPress will solve many of your problems very quickly) and learning how things work (understand that WordPress is built in PHP, and if you know PHP you can get WordPress to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; rather than being limited by WordPress plugins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-approach-data-security:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Do You Approach Data Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate in that most of what I do isn&amp;rsquo;t sensitive. (The most sensitive data I deal with is email addresses — and I try to avoid even dealing with those.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tunnelbear.com/&#34;&gt;TunnelBear&lt;/a&gt; as a simple, cheap &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network&#34;&gt;VPN&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple solution that will do a pretty good job of protecting my data without making security an additional job for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://db.tt/gPmxlbE&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;disclosure: if you sign up with that link, I get bonus storage&lt;/em&gt;) to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t lose any data — I could drop my computer off a cliff and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose any of my files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-long-do-you-intend-to-travel:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Long Do You Intend to Travel?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a definite answer to this question. I intend to travel for as long as travel seems like the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always checking in with myself: am I doing this because I&amp;rsquo;ve convinced myself that I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person that travels, or because it actually makes me happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time may come in a decade, a year, a month — or tomorrow — when I decide that I&amp;rsquo;d be happier if I was in one place instead of moving every few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t see an end in sight. I expect I&amp;rsquo;ll be traveling for at least the next couple years unless something unexpected happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-overcome-the-absence-of-in-person-interaction:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;How Do You Overcome the Absence of In-Person Interaction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John asks, &amp;ldquo;How do you make sure people remember you when you&amp;rsquo;re not in the room? If your best impression is face-to-face, how do you preserve that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I build my business as a &amp;ldquo;remote first&amp;rdquo; workplace. I&amp;rsquo;ve always worked with people without regard for geographical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I would only correspond with my clients by email, but there were drawbacks to this: my relationships were weak and strictly business, and it can be hard to communicate tone effectively. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;d think I was making a silly joke, and my client would think I was being a dick; other times, I&amp;rsquo;d think my client was unhappy, but they&amp;rsquo;d just responded in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I require phone calls (preferably video calls) for big deliverables and check-ins. This allows me to walk through what I did and why, and gather feedback in realtime. It also allows discussion, just like a face-to-face meeting would. You lose the stiffness of email, and you build a real connection with your clients. This has resolved a lot of conflicts before they had a chance to start — it&amp;rsquo;s easy to yell in an email; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to yell at someone who&amp;rsquo;s right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do try to show up where my clients are from time to time. If I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be somewhere that a client lives, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to meet them for dinner or coffee. When a conference is happening where a good group of my clients is planning to show up, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can make it work. Even with video calls, there&amp;rsquo;s a huge amount of added value in just spending time with people, in person, without any agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-yourself-useful:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;Make Yourself Useful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I meet a potential client, I don&amp;rsquo;t try to sell them something. I just share a solution if I have one.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This establishes me as an expert and — even if they don&amp;rsquo;t hire me — they&amp;rsquo;ll remember that I was able to help them out. If they meet someone who needs help in the future, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a referral, and if they need to hire help in the future they&amp;rsquo;ll think of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-questions-do-you-have-about-going-location-independent:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a&#34;&gt;What Questions Do You Have About Going Location-Independent?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John had questions that centered largely around technical skills, running a freelance business, and client acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What questions do you have about becoming location-independent? Click the discussion link and fire away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;For the technically inclined, I&amp;rsquo;m working heavily in realtime video right now: Node.js, Socket.IO, WebRTC powering the back-end, and a plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS UI.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:techstack&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;My dad would play the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; game in reverse when I was growing up. Whenever I had a chore, or a homework assignment, or anything at all, really, my dad would ask me how it was done. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get away with cop-out answers: I needed to have a thorough understanding of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; priming a lawn mower helped it start; or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was faster to sweep out the garage if I followed a pattern instead of whisking the dirt around haphazardly; &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the lights turned on when I flipped the switch. As a kid, it was fucking infuriating; as an adult, I don&amp;rsquo;t think any other single factor has contributed as much to my success as my ingrained habit of asking why something works (or doesn&amp;rsquo;t) instead of shrugging and continuing about my business.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:dad&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;In the audio, I refer to &amp;ldquo;Code School&amp;rdquo; in Portland as a bootcamp. It&amp;rsquo;s actually called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epicodus.com/&#34;&gt;Epicodus&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:hands-on&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;I had some of my facts wrong in the audio interview. I talked about languages having ancestors, which isn&amp;rsquo;t correct. &lt;a href=&#34;https://line.do/ww/history-of-php/r5q4x1/vertical&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; in C. JavaScript is a standard of its own, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005729/what-language-is-javascript-written-in&#34;&gt;interpreters&lt;/a&gt; that are written in C, C++, Java, or even — in truly meta fashion — JavaScript.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:clarification&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested this theory, but I have a hunch this applies to spoken language as well. I&amp;rsquo;m getting better at Spanish, and just barely starting to learn French; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily feel &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; to learn French, but I have some strategies and constructs in place that are definitely helpful.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:spoken&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;Sharing a solution is very different from doing actual work. If we&amp;rsquo;re talking and I can help you out by just rattling off some knowledge I have that applies to your situation, then I&amp;rsquo;ll do that. But I won&amp;rsquo;t pull out my laptop and solve the problem for you unless we work out a budget and scope first.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:40764f8fabb8b8dbf4b836b6c199189a:solution&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Ditch the Day Job: How to Become Location-Independent</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Becoming location independent clears the way for you to start working from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever considered long-term travel, location-independent income is a non-negotiable part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started, though, can be stressful — and scary as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by telling you how I made the transition out of the traditional workplace and into a role that allows me to make a living no matter where I am in the world. (Hello from Thailand!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterward, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over several options for making a living from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-departure-from-the-9-to-5:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;My Departure from the 9-to-5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early twenties, I moonlighted as a freelance web developer while keeping 9-to-5 jobs ranging from a night auditor at a hotel to a project manager at a Kinko&amp;rsquo;s to a graveyard shift cook at a bowling alley diner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to work for myself, but I had no idea where to start. I only had a few clients, and sometimes I would go a month between jobs. What if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find work? What if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay my rent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last job — working at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s — was a huge help in building my resolve to avoid corporate culture. Kinko&amp;rsquo;s had just been acquired by FedEx, and I watched as all the things that Kinko&amp;rsquo;s used to do for employees that made them love their jobs were systematically stripped away and replaced with more aggressive performance goals and stricter punishments for missing them —all with little or no reward for meeting goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a year I watched FedEx methodically dismantle employee morale. I kept my spirits up by working my off hours on web projects, repeating to myself over and over, &lt;em&gt;This is just for now. Things will get better soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-terrifying-glimmer-of-hope:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;A Terrifying Glimmer of Hope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my chance, it felt like a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/best-friends/&#34;&gt;good friend&lt;/a&gt; had introduced me to a guy named David, who was trying to start a company building simple websites for B-list-or-lower actors and performers. His budget wasn&amp;rsquo;t huge, but he could offer me $1,300/month for three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was spending about $1,050/month on living expenses. If I took David&amp;rsquo;s offer, I&amp;rsquo;d have $250/month to pay my mobile phone bill, buy any necessities, and, y&amp;rsquo;know, &lt;em&gt;eat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was only three months of guaranteed income. What if he didn&amp;rsquo;t renew for a fourth month? What if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any income?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-siren-song-of-security:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;The Siren Song of Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same week I started discussing David&amp;rsquo;s project, I got an unexpected offer from a local creative agency. They asked me to come in and interview with them — they&amp;rsquo;d heard of me because of my volunteer work with a local coders&amp;rsquo; meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through the interview process, which involved several days&amp;rsquo; worth of meetings with different department heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they told me they were prepared to offer me a job as a web developer and designer. I would more or less be the entirety of their digital department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, we finally got down to heavy details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d want to bring you in at a mid-range salary to show you that we&amp;rsquo;re serious,&amp;rdquo; said the woman who made the hiring decisions. &amp;ldquo;We can offer you $30,000/year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a rush of mixed emotions. On the one hand, $2,500/month was more than I&amp;rsquo;d ever made before, and it would provide me with significantly more spending money than the freelance gig. But on the other hand, $30K was a &lt;em&gt;mid-range&lt;/em&gt; developer salary at this agency? I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was normal, but this felt pretty low to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; I started carefully, &amp;ldquo;so assuming this all goes well and I&amp;rsquo;m a good fit for the team. What&amp;rsquo;s my growth potential here? Would I be able to see an increase in that salary after proving I&amp;rsquo;m able to handle the workload here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She shifted uncomfortably. &amp;ldquo;Well, yes. I would say you have the potential to make up to $35,000 a year here, assuming everything goes well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt my heart sink. I had a vision of software development at an ad agency as a glamorous job, full of challenging work and long hours, but with high pay to make it all worth it. But this job was offering me less than my manager at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s made in a year, with virtually no growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little voice&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; nagged at me that this was &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a steady paycheck&lt;/em&gt;. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-by-on-ramen-noodles-and-hope:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Getting By on Ramen Noodles and Hope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep much the next few days. I kept rolling around my options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical part of me was convinced. &lt;em&gt;Take the agency job. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of money, but it&amp;rsquo;s experience that you can use to trade up in a couple years. And it&amp;rsquo;s not like you&amp;rsquo;re taking a pay cut to move into a job you like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my gut didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re only considering this agency job because you&amp;rsquo;re a chickenshit,&lt;/em&gt; it hissed at me. &lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been telling everyone you know that you just need a chance to be self-employed, and now you have that chance. So are you going to take it? Or are you a liar and a coward?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was right, I realized. I had been looking for this chance for over a year, and now it was in my hands. If I turned it down, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure how long it would take to get another chance like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the agency and declined, citing my concerns about growth potential. They seemed miffed, but it also sounded like they were already expecting me to turn it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called David and accepted the contract. He told me he&amp;rsquo;d drop the check in the mail that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put in my two weeks&amp;rsquo; notice at Kinko&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I bought a pallet of ramen noodles, sat down on my couch, and hyperventilated for the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-payoff:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;The Payoff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Kinko&amp;rsquo;s, a funny thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leads I&amp;rsquo;d been talking to for months without any movement were suddenly ready to pull the trigger. I started getting new leads around town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost like people could smell that I&amp;rsquo;d started taking web development seriously. I was no longer doing web design on the side; &lt;em&gt;I was a web developer, full stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between receiving David&amp;rsquo;s first check and the end of our contract (five months later), I had built up enough business to be bringing in an average of $3,000/month. If I could keep this up, I&amp;rsquo;d make $36,000 or so for the year — more than the agency would have paid assuming they found me especially good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was terrified to leave the security of my day job. I was convinced that I had no hope of making a decent living on my own. I was sure that the concerns of my parents, past employers, teachers — basically every adult I&amp;rsquo;d ever met — were correct and that the only way to really make it was to get a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job: the kind with health insurance and paid vacation and annual reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my instincts said there was a better way. And I took a leap of faith, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/&#34;&gt;set myself on fire&lt;/a&gt;, and trusted myself to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my life has never been the same since. I&amp;rsquo;m happier now, more confident in myself, less bothered by the unknown — every part of my life improved as a direct result of taking charge of my life and becoming self-employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-options-exist-for-remote-work:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;What Options Exist for Remote Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for making a living without having to be physically present in a particular place. Three of the most common (and versatile) options are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a passive income stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convince your boss to let you work remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from anywhere as a freelancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-passive-income:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Create Passive Income&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive income is the most alluring form of making money remotely. After all, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to make money while they sleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal experience with passive income has been generating it for other people; my own passive revenue streams are limited to affiliate sales on Amazon, book royalties, and whatever my investments earn — in short, it&amp;rsquo;s a very small part of my overall income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I won&amp;rsquo;t talk too much about generating passive income. There are other people more qualified to cover the subject — check out Chris Guillebeau&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307951529/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307951529&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jl1985-20&amp;amp;linkId=MDOK4KJXNHWBOYVV&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;$100 Startup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-products:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Digital Products&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful passive revenue stream I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to reproduce for my clients has been digital products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my friend and client &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theptdc.com/who-we-are/jonathan-goodman-2/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Goodman&lt;/a&gt; runs a business from all over the world that sells digital products helping personal trainers become better at personal training, selling their services, and establishing additional revenue streams like online coaching. He has a small handful of products — most of which he created, built a marketing funnel for, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t had to touch (much) since — that earn him a comfortable living without a lot of weekly effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-services:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Online Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another friend and client, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnromaniello.com/&#34;&gt;John &amp;ldquo;Roman&amp;rdquo; Romaniello&lt;/a&gt;, has built passive income by creating companies that he more or less only provides ideas for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roman&amp;rsquo;s created an online client management platform that he uses for his own online clients, but that he also sells to other coaches on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has a development team to keep it afloat, a management and marketing team to keep it running smoothly, and various other people on his team to take care of the day-to-day operation of the company — his only real job at the company is to give direction for what the team should focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;passive-is-kind-of-a-misnomer:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Passive&amp;rdquo; Is Kind of a Misnomer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important, though, to note that while Jon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to put a lot of effort into building the products themselves, and Roman doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to deal with much of the daily operations of his coaching platform, both of these guys spend &lt;em&gt;a lot of time&lt;/em&gt; working on creating content and staying active on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive income is very rarely &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; passive, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-a-full-time-job-that-lets-you-work-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Find a Full-Time Job That Lets You Work Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is a little bit like having your cake and eating it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can find full-time employment that&amp;rsquo;s entirely remote, you&amp;rsquo;ve effectively managed to hold on to the security of a 9-to-5 job while also gaining the freedom of working from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hunt-for-remote-jobs:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Hunt for Remote Jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, being a remote worker is no longer uncommon. Many notable companies, including Automattic (the company that built WordPress), Basecamp, and Buffer are almost entirely remote, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics&#34;&gt;reports claim&lt;/a&gt; that 3.3 million full-time employees in the US workforce were able to telecommute at least part of the time as of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone looking to start a new career, or move to a new job, there are a large number of job boards that specialize exclusively in listing remote jobs, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://remoteok.io/&#34;&gt;remoteok.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jobs.remotive.io/&#34;&gt;jobs.remotive.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://weworkremotely.com/&#34;&gt;weworkremotely.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wfh.io/&#34;&gt;WFH.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other options — if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for remote work, you won&amp;rsquo;t have too much trouble finding companies willing to hire you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;convince-your-boss-to-let-you-work-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little more challenging, but if you feel confident that you can do your existing job without going into the office, it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying to convince your boss that it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a strong case for why the company would be better off with you telecommuting, and build trust in your ability to work from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For an in-depth strategy, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/convince-your-boss-remote-work/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;freelance-remotely:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Freelance Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously the simplest and most difficult way to make a living remotely, freelancing is one of the most common approaches taken by digital nomads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the riskiest prospect because there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee of work, but with a little care and a lot of effort, you can build a strong referral network to keep your sales funnel full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-yourself-as-an-expert:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Position Yourself as an Expert&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find things that you&amp;rsquo;re very good at and interested in — the things you get excited talking about — and start teaching them: speak at local meetups, submit conference talk proposals, write tutorials, and do anything you can to publicly stake a claim that you &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; whatever arena you want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes you appear to be an authority, and people looking for freelancers want to hire the best available help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, &lt;strong&gt;nothing will force you to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know your shit like trying to teach it to someone else.&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t gloss over details when you&amp;rsquo;re explaining it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-damn-sure-you-get-a-good-referral:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Make Damn Sure You Get a Good Referral&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working remotely, you may not get the chance to go out and meet your clients — especially in more remote locations — so you need to make sure that other people are doing your sales for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get a client, become their hero. They&amp;rsquo;ve come to you to solve a problem, so solve that problem completely, and make sure they know what&amp;rsquo;s going on at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can A) solve your clients&amp;rsquo; problems for them, and B) make sure they never felt like you had disappeared&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; during the project, you&amp;rsquo;re almost ensured a good referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each successful project, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to ask your client to either send you a testimonial (you can use this for marketing, too) or ask them to complete a survey about your performance — in either case, they finish the project by reminding themselves all the things they liked about working with you. Later, when a friend mentions a problem that you can solve, your client will be eager to drop your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remove-the-anchor-of-office-bound-work:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc&#34;&gt;Remove the Anchor of Office-Bound Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing the anchor of reporting to an office every day is an astonishingly liberating accomplishment, whether your goal is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-travel/&#34;&gt;sell everything and travel the world&lt;/a&gt;, or simply to cut your commute and eliminate the requirement to wear pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also daunting, and it requires some legwork to make it happen. But don&amp;rsquo;t give up — I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to meet &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who made the transition to remote work and regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;This voice sounded alarmingly similar to my mother&amp;rsquo;s.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:mom&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;#protip: The window of time between your last communication and when the client will wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is much shorter than you think. Daily communication is ideal — you don&amp;rsquo;t need to deliver something every day, but make sure they know you&amp;rsquo;re working on their project.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:c51eaed3932b197d41756e8db78d0bdc:communication&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of benefits to being an employee. Things like health care, paid vacation, and — of course — a steady paycheck are nothing to scoff at. But if you&amp;rsquo;re sick of being stuck in an office, how can you convince your boss to let you work remotely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re ready to take off and see the world, looking to cut down on your commute, or if you&amp;rsquo;d just like to have extra time with your loved ones, telecommuting is the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the business world seems to be coming around to telecommuting, you may still be facing an uphill battle to convince your boss to let you cut the cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you convince your boss to let you work from home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

       alt=&#34;how to convince your boss to let your work from home&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class=&#34;caption-text&#34;&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-out-the-logistics-ahead-of-time:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Work Out the Logistics Ahead of Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your boss to take your proposal seriously, make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve got all the details worked out before you bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your office has anything special in place — a VPN, for example — figure out how you can connect to it from home. Be ready to explain, in vivid detail, all the ways you&amp;rsquo;ll be overcoming hurdles between you and your goal of working from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arm-yourself-with-research:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Arm Yourself with Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re ready to back up your claims with actual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to have any trouble finding research to support your claims. There&amp;rsquo;s a growing mountain of research papers proving that employees &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; employers benefit from remote working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look for it, you&amp;rsquo;ll find data proving that remote workers are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794&#34;&gt;less likely to quit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home&#34;&gt;more productive&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sqwiggle.com/working-remotely-saves-money/&#34;&gt;less expensive for the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg; for a more in-depth look, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-everyone-wins/&#34;&gt;how remote work is a win for everyone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-the-benefits-to-the-company:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Focus on the Benefits to the Company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in your boss&amp;rsquo;s shoes: if someone walked into your office and started talking about this thing they want you to let them do that will make their lives super awesome but that makes no difference for you, what&amp;rsquo;s your initial reaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be nonplussed about the whole idea. Why should you bother putting the effort into changing this arrangement if it only benefits one person? There are surely other projects you could work on that would benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, you might be inclined to turn down the idea because it sounds awesome and you want it, but you can&amp;rsquo;t have it, so no one should have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you bring the idea to your boss, compare these two statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: How Working Remotely Benefits You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you let me work from home, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to spend more time with my family and friends, avoid the commute, and have fewer distractions when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get stuff done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: How Working Remotely Benefits Your Boss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I work from home, you&amp;rsquo;ll be saving the company over $10,000 each year, studies have shown a 13.5% boost in remote productivity over office-based productivity, and remote workers are also more likely to take ownership of their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re the boss, which one sounds like a better call for the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you&amp;rsquo;re not the boss, you&amp;rsquo;re asking for exactly the same outcome with both statements; one just makes you sound selfish, and one makes you sound like a team player looking out for the company&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-small-with-trial-runs:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Start Small with Trial Runs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never worked remotely before, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to propose that you just&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t come in anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, propose something small, like one day per week to work remotely. It should go without saying that your teleworking day needs to be your most productive for the week to prove the point that this is better for everyone. (To give yourself a running start on your remote days, make sure you have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/effective-project-planning/&#34;&gt;clear plan&lt;/a&gt; for what you&amp;rsquo;re going to work on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve established that you&amp;rsquo;re reliable as a remote worker, attempt to up the number of days out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to prove that you&amp;rsquo;re better when you&amp;rsquo;re not in the office, and that nothing went wrong without your physical presence. You can use the evidence to support your case to go fully remote — it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to make the case if you&amp;rsquo;ve got metrics, so use something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com/&#34;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of how your time was spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-forgiveness-not-permission:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company isn&amp;rsquo;t receptive to a trial period, you can always adopt a different tactic and drag them, kicking and screaming, to victory.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call in sick on a weekday — probably not a Monday or Friday so you don&amp;rsquo;t look like you&amp;rsquo;re trying to squeeze out a long weekend — and just work remotely. Get your tasks done, keep in touch with your team, and handle the day like you would if it was a normal, remote working day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a note of how much more productive the day was. If you can prove it, prove it. If not, make sure your boss is included on the task completion notices so they can see that you cranked things out from home — even while &amp;ldquo;sick&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad used this technique to build up to the point where he was only coming into the office a couple times a month. After a while, he would take his phone as a mobile hotspot out on his boat and work while fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His boss was none the wiser — after several months of working from his favorite fishing hole, his boss finally asked him to come into the office. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of a lake right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than getting in trouble for surreptitiously working from wherever he felt like for months, my dad was able to remove all ties from his office because they realized that, really, he&amp;rsquo;d already done it without their knowledge. They never had a clue because he never faltered in his productivity or responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;don-t-give-up:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Give Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a traditional 9-to-5 role, convincing your boss to let you leave the office is going to be an uphill battle in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that big changes take time, and often times the resistance to an idea isn&amp;rsquo;t due to someone disagreeing with you; it&amp;rsquo;s just too new and uncomfortable, and they need some time to chew on it before they can consider it objectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to convince your boss to let you work remotely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all your ducks in a row and be ready to overcome any logistical objections about your ability to get the job done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be ready to present research to back up all your claims that remote work is a win for the company as much as it is for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the ways that remote work will benefit your boss; people are much more motivated by self-interest, and bosses want to look good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t go for full independence right out of the gate. Instead, start with trial runs to prove that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to work with your boss to prove this is good for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t convince your boss, you can try to just do it anyways and ask for forgiveness instead of permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, if all else fails, you can look at other &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/how-to-become-location-independent/&#34;&gt;ways of becoming location independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I want to help you avoid my mistake: you can start living the life of your dreams right now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/&#34;&gt;free step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to show you how.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:44e33bcb7b5407046c6d7da22589ebee:faintofheart&#34;&gt;This technique is not for the faint of heart. You need to be willing to 100% own this decision — if you falter, or seem anything less than unwaveringly convinced that you&amp;rsquo;re in the right, this technique could end up harming your career. Use at your own risk.
