<p>Marisa is a few months into her new career as a <a href="http://marisamorby.com">freelance copywriter and editor</a>.</p>

<p>She has a literature degree<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:degree"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:degree">1</a></sup> and hundreds of thousands of words under her belt. She&rsquo;s written for <a href="https://www.themuse.com/author/marisa-morby">large</a> <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/author/marisa-morby">publications</a>. She&rsquo;s created an <a href="http://creatingtheconversation.com/hire-probability-not-potential/">information product</a> and the marketing to go with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this to establish a fact: Marisa is extremely well-qualified to work as a copywriter. Anyone who hires her will be very happy with the result.</p>

<p><strong>But despite all her qualifications, her freelance career was slow out of the gate. The skill was there, but the clients weren&rsquo;t piling up.</strong></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<h2 id="100-of-becoming-a-freelancer-is-sales:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">100% of Becoming a Freelancer Is Sales</h2>

<p>If you spend more than a few minutes skimming <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/">the freelance Subreddit</a>, you&rsquo;ll likely see at least a half-dozen posts from freelancers who are struggling and unhappy because they don&rsquo;t have steady work.</p>

<p>These are all qualified people<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:reddit"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:reddit">2</a></sup> who could easily handle freelance contracts. And yet they&rsquo;re stuck without work, or forced to race to the bottom on sites like Upwork.</p>

<p>But these people aren&rsquo;t <em>freelancers</em> â€” they&rsquo;re employees without bosses.</p>

<p><strong>Freelancers areÂ â€” first and foremost â€” salespeople.</strong></p>

</p>

<p>The truth about freelancing is that getting hired as a freelancer has exactly <em>nothing</em> to do with your abilities as a freelancer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an analogy to try and put this in perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Say I need a deck built. I haven&rsquo;t done anything resembling construction or woodworking since I made a lopsided toothpick box in seventh grade shop class, so I&rsquo;m walking in pretty blind here.</p>

<p>I start by asking people I trust: my dad, who&rsquo;s had things built before; my friends who own houses; a buddy who used to work construction. Do they know anyone I could ask about building the deck?</p>

<p>After people I trust, I might put the word out through whatever channels are available to me. A call for help on Facebook or Twitter. Maybe someone knows someone.</p>

<p>Then I consult the internet at large. Are there any reviews? Who&rsquo;s the best deck-builder in my city?</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;ll have a list. Or, more than likely, one of my trusted sources will have a recommendation, and I&rsquo;ll just go with that unquestioningly â€” why doubt the endorsement of someone I trust?</p>

<p>So here I am, a deck contract awarded, and I know nothing about my contractor except that my friend Troy likes him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A freelancer&rsquo;s skills mean jack shit in the decision-making process for most clients.</strong> You know that cheesy clichÃ©, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <em>what</em> you know; it&rsquo;s <em>who</em> you know&rdquo;?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a clichÃ© for a reason.</p>

<h2 id="100-of-building-client-relationships-is-skill:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">100% of Building Client Relationships Is Skill</h2>

<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s so much more to freelancing than sales!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course. But none of that matters if you&rsquo;re not selling.</p>

<p>Where sales stop mattering is <em>after</em> the sale is made. <strong>Once you&rsquo;ve won a client, gotten a deposit, and started a project, your sales ability can&rsquo;t help you anymore â€” you&rsquo;re on the hook to be good at your job.</strong></p>

<p>Your talent as a freelancer will make clients happy, and it will keep them coming back. Plus, it creates referrals â€”Â which we&rsquo;ll come back to in a few minutes.</p>

<h2 id="selling-feels-gross:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Selling Feels Gross</h2>

<p>Look: I hate selling. <em>Hate it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Accosting a friend or stranger and asking for money feels presumptuous, invasive, and greasy.</strong></p>

</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never made a cold call in my life.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:coldcalls">3</a></sup> I&rsquo;ve sent fewer than a dozen unsolicited emails asking for business. I get anxiety thinking about approaching someone who has no idea who I am and trying to convince them I&rsquo;m worth money.</p>

<p>The power dynamics are weird; the approach puts me at a social disadvantage, and forces me to work extra hard to prove I know something. I would never buy something from a stranger I&rsquo;ve never heard of before; why would I expect anyone to buy from me when I&rsquo;m a stranger?</p>

<h3 id="you-still-have-to-own-your-position:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">You Still Have to Own Your Position</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like approaching someone cold, but I have no issue whatsoever telling someone what I do â€” what I <em>am</em>.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s critical to fully own your ability to do the job you&rsquo;re telling people you can do.</strong> If you don&rsquo;t trust yourself to be outstanding at your job, why should anyone else?</p>

<p>Before I started freelancing full time, I waffled on what I was. Was I a guy who worked at Kinko&rsquo;s and made the odd website on the side? Or was I a web designer working to bootstrap a new freelance business?</p>

<p>I felt like an impostor telling people I was a web designer. They&rsquo;d think I was a liar if they walked into Kinko&rsquo;s and saw me there, right?</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not a healthy way to look at things. When I was younger, this wasn&rsquo;t an issue for me: sure, I worked at Pizza Hut part-time, but I was a <em>musician</em> first and foremost. My band didn&rsquo;t make much money, but we practiced a few times a week and played a show every month or so.</p>

<p>For some reason, it was much easier to tell people I was a musician than to tell them I was a web designer.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:roles"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:roles">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Maybe it was easier to call myself a musician because I had a group of friends to be part of my band, and as a freelancer I was just a guy working alone on my couch.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because being a freelancer seemed more important, and I was more afraid of failure.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, something made me uncomfortable about saying the phrase, &ldquo;I am a freelance web designer.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="confidence-is-critical:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Confidence Is Critical</h3>

<p>When I finally quit my job at Kinko&rsquo;s to become a full-time freelancer, my confidence instantly shot through the roof. I had <a href="http://lengstorf.com/set-yourself-on-fire/">set myself on fire</a>, and it was time to put up or shut up.</p>

<p>

<figure class="caption alignright">

  <figcaption class="caption-text">
    
  You have to believe in yourself, or no one else will.

    
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p><strong>As soon as I felt like a &ldquo;real&rdquo; web designer, I immediately started landing more business.</strong> I don&rsquo;t think this was a coincidence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a chicken-egg problem: in order to have confidence about our abilities, we feel like we need clients; but in order to get clients, we need to have confidence in our abilities.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to sell people my services, mind you. I simply felt more confident saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a web designer, and I can build awesome websites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>People sensed my confidence, and suddenly I was being approached more often about jobs.</p>

<p>

<h2 id="how-to-sell-without-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">How to Sell Without Selling</h2>

<p>Confidence doesn&rsquo;t solve all problems, though. I was getting approached for jobs, but that was because people knew who I was.</p>

<p>But if I didn&rsquo;t like selling and wasn&rsquo;t cold-calling people, how did anyone know who I was?</p>

<p>The way I see it, there are two ways to get new business as a freelancer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sell your services</li>
<li>Have other people sell your services for you</li>
</ol>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t all that comfortable with option 1, so I wanted to find a way to make option 2 happen.</p>

<p><strong>I needed to create a killer referral network.</strong></p>

<h3 id="there-s-still-some-selling-involved:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">There&rsquo;s Still Some Selling Involved</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let me mislead you into thinking you won&rsquo;t have to do any sellingÂ â€” that&rsquo;s, unfortunately, just not true.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have to sell. But you can do a different, more comfortable kind of selling.</p>

<p><strong>Instead of selling to strangers, start selling to your network.</strong></p>

<p>For most people, there&rsquo;s a loose network of acquaintances and &ldquo;buddies&rdquo; spread through the community, state, country, and/or world. Not necessarily people that you keep in touch with daily, but the kind of people you speak to every month or two â€” just to catch up.</p>

<h3 id="be-willing-to-ask-for-help:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Be Willing to Ask for Help</h3>

<p>When you talk to these folks, they&rsquo;ll inevitably ask you, &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, the default answer might be to say, &ldquo;Not much. I&rsquo;m working as a freelancer now, which is pretty exciting. How are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is factual, <em>but it could be much better.</em></p>

<p>Now, look: we&rsquo;re not trying to scam our friends into anything. But we <em>do</em> want to make sure our friends are aware of what we&rsquo;re doing, and that they could help us do better.</p>

<p>So when our friend asks, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; we don&rsquo;t brush the question off. Instead, we present a friendly, opt-in request:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, my biggest news is that I&rsquo;ve just start working as a freelance web designer, which is pretty exciting. The biggest challenge so far is finding clients, so if you know anyone who needs a website, I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you&rsquo;d drop my name or make an intro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You haven&rsquo;t asked for anything that puts your friend out. All you&rsquo;re doing is putting it in her head that she can help you out.</strong></p>

<p>Remember the deck analogy from earlier? People love to have the answers to other people&rsquo;s problems. <strong>If my friend can connect me to someone who needs my services, she wins twice:</strong> she helped me grow my business, and helped her other friend solve their website problem.</p>

<h3 id="you-don-t-have-to-wait-for-an-opening:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">You Don&rsquo;t Have to Wait for an Opening</h3>

<p>You can also start this conversation. Email your acquaintances to catch them up on things, including a nudge to send any potential leads your way.</p>

<p>That email is almost the same. It might look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, friendâ€“</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;re doing well! I wanted to drop you a line to see how things are going and catch up.</p>

<p><em>[Talk about things that are relevant: do they have kids? were they starting something new last time you spoke?]</em></p>

<p>Things on my end are pretty exciting right now. My biggest news is that I&rsquo;ve just start working as a freelance web designer. The biggest challenge so far is finding clients, so if you know anyone who needs a website, I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you&rsquo;d drop my name or make an intro.</p>

<p><em>[Catch them up on anything else in your life that you want to share here.]</em></p>

<p>Anyways, I hope you&rsquo;re having an awesome summer. I&rsquo;ll look forward to hearing from you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This message isn&rsquo;t hiding an agenda. You&rsquo;re not trying to weasel something out of a friend. You&rsquo;re simply sharing big life news and making it known that â€” if they happen to hear someone needs a website â€” they can help you out by spreading the word.</p>

<p>If you sent this message without the note about referring leads, it would still be a meaningful message to you and your friend.</p>

<h3 id="remember-these-are-your-friends:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Remember: These Are Your Friends</h3>

<p>The big goal, of course, is not to be a dick about this. You are <em>not</em> going to get good results by pestering everyone you know about buying a website to &ldquo;help you out&rdquo; or whatever. That&rsquo;s multi-level marketing â€” are you a freelancer, or are you hawking Scentsy candles?</p>

<p><strong>Before you send an email, make sure you wouldn&rsquo;t be upset if you received the same email from your friend.</strong> It&rsquo;s one thing to be made aware that someone is looking for work; it&rsquo;s another thing entirely to be pumped for leads and/or pressured into buying things.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be fine if you just follow Wheaton&rsquo;s Law: <strong>don&rsquo;t be a dick.</strong></p>

<h2 id="grow-your-network:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Grow Your Network</h2>

<p>In addition to your existing network, make an effort to meet peopleÂ â€”Â especially people who are in the industries you&rsquo;d like to work with.</p>

<p>This has the added benefit of building a community. You can help people in whatever way you&rsquo;re able, and they&rsquo;ll be able to reciprocate as best as possible.</p>

</p>

<p>When I first started out, I started attending a small group called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Montana-Programmers/">MT Programmers</a> in Missoula. <strong>I started to get involved, and through the people I met there, I was introduced to more and more people in the community</strong> â€” more than a few of my first gigs came from these introductions.</p>

<p>Later, I spent money to attend conferences, and <strong>I found myself surrounded by people who were focusing on their businesses and willing to spend money to get what they needed</strong> â€” often, this meant they needed website help, so it naturally came up in conversation that we could help each other out.</p>

<h3 id="bring-your-clients-into-your-network:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Bring Your Clients into Your Network</h3>

<p>Every time I get a new project, I bust my ass to make sure the client is really happy with me. I know that <strong>happy clients are worth <em>way more</em> than just the value of a given project.</strong></p>

<p>Many of my clients became life-long friends. I&rsquo;ve been invited to book launch parties, weddings, vacations, and more. This could never have happened if I didn&rsquo;t show that I&rsquo;m a stand-up guy through my work.</p>

<p>From a financial perspective, lots of my clients came back later with additional projects. Far more of them referred friends and colleagues to me.</p>

<h3 id="ask-clients-for-referrals:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Ask Clients for Referrals</h3>

<p>Part of my wrapping-up process with clients is to send an email letting them know that I don&rsquo;t advertise, and the only way I get new clients is by word-of-mouth from my existing clients. I ask them â€” if they feel like I did a good job and they&rsquo;re happy with my work â€” to please keep me in mind if they meet someone else who needs a website.</p>

<p>I also offer a referral bonus as a token of my appreciation. It&rsquo;s not much â€” $100 for any referral who signs on with me â€” but I like to send it over as a token of my appreciation.</p>

<p>I make sure to send a personal note thanking the person for each referral as well, except in the case of my highest-referring clients â€” they send too many leads, so I&rsquo;d be spamming them.</p>

<h2 id="eventually-you-can-stop-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Eventually You Can Stop Selling</h2>

<p>After a couple years, <strong>I had a large enough network that my referral stream was too much for me to handle.</strong> I received several inquiries a week from people who were serious about web projects.</p>

<p>I was swamped. I had to hire subcontractors to help. I had a waiting list.</p>

<p>And <strong>this meant I never had to go out and &ldquo;do sales&rdquo;</strong> the way that freelancers typically view sales. No cold calls or emails, no advertising, no proposals. Just a steady stream of referrals â€” which is a different (far less awkward) type of selling.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8:dating">5</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="freelancing-is-for-conversationalists:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">Freelancing Is for Conversationalists</h2>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s direct sales or leveraging a network for introductions, <strong>your job as a freelancer is to generate conversations with people who may need your services.</strong></p>

<p>This means that your ability to speak in a clear and friendly manner is perhaps your most valuable skill. If you sound confident, and you don&rsquo;t seem like a dick, chances are you&rsquo;ll get the job over someone who seems unsure or comes off as abrasive.</p>

<p><strong>As unfair as it may seem, a freelancer with better conversational skills will likely win a job over a more competent freelancer who speaks poorly.</strong></p>

<h2 id="you-can-be-successful-without-selling:5a60a7c2d0a1ec88cefdcd1d049c39b8">You Can Be Successful Without Selling</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a slower road than hard selling, but you can successfully build a freelance career only by networking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Let your friends know what you&rsquo;re doing</li>
<li>Ask them to refer anyone who might need your services</li>
<li>Go out and meet people â€” especially if they&rsquo;re in your target demographic</li>
<li>Be helpful and confident</li>
<li>Kick ass for your clients</li>
<li>Ask them for referrals</li>
</ol>

<p>I had a referral network after my first project, and it grew steadily with each new project I took on. It seemed to me that most projects would lead to one referral, and every once in a while a project would lead to a huge number of referrals.</p>

<p>So if you hate sales, don&rsquo;t worry â€” you can still be a freelancer. You may need to hold onto your day job a bit longer, but you can get there.</p>

<p>Just stay confident, ask for leads, and remember that your skills finish the job and earn new referrals â€” so do good work.</p>

<p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream â€” but you don&rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t start living this life sooner.

            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
