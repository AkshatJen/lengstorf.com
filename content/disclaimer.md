This blog is personal, and not intended to solve any problems or diagnose any disease. So let's just assume for everyone's sake that I don't know shit about shit, and you shouldn't trust me at all.

Everything I say on this blog is an opinion, and there's a reasonable chance that I'm absolutely wrong about everything.

Please seek the advice of a professional before trying anything I've written. All of my posts are written about things that I did that worked for me. Your results may vary â€” try this stuff at your own risk.

If you'd like to let me know that something I did was demonstrably incorrect, please [contact me][1].

## Disclosure

Some of the links on this site are affiliate links. That means that if you sign up or purchase something I've recommended after clicking the link, I'll make a little bit of money. The presence of an affiliate link will never increase the price you pay for an item, but in some cases it gives you a discount or bonus.

I use every product I recommend unless I've noted otherwise.
