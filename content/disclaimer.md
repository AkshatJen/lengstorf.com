This blog is personal, and not intended to solve any problems or diagnose any disease. So let's just assume for everyone's sake that I don't know shit about shit, and you shouldn't trust me at all.

Everything I say on this blog is an opinion, and there's a reasonable chance that I'm absolutely wrong about everything.

Please seek the advice of a professional before trying anything I've written. All of my posts are written about things I did that worked for me. Your results may vary — try this stuff at your own risk.

To translate that: "Use your head. And if you choose _not_ to use your head, I can't be held responsible."

If something I did was demonstrably incorrect, I'd like to hear about it so I can make corrections — please [contact me]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}).
