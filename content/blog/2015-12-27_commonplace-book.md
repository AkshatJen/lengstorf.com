I started reading [_Where Good Ideas Come From_](http://amzn.to/1QOSd4A) by Steven Johnson last week.

In it, Johnson talks about Charles Darwin, and the process by which the theory of natural selection came about. There was no Aha Moment; no flash of sudden insight; no wise old man with the final piece to the puzzle[^malthus] — Darwin's idea formed slowly, over the course of years.

[^malthus]:
    Though there was almost a wise old man with the final piece of the puzzle: Darwin read an essay by Malthus, after which he wrote, "Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work." Except he'd already been talking about natural selection for about a year in his writing — he just hadn't realized it yet.

Johnson calls this a "slow hunch", and attributes several great breakthroughs in history to it. His argument, really, is that very few ideas happen suddenly and without warning; rather, "they fade into view."

## The Tragically Short Half-Life of Ideas

    How to cross the street in Vietnam.
{{< /caption >}}

Three days ago I was walking home in Hanoi. I was walking in the street because sidewalks aren't really for walking here; they were packed with people sitting on tiny stools, enjoying street food and [bia hoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia_h%C6%A1i).

Scooters weaved through the pedestrian press, blasting horns, carrying everything from families of four to refrigerator-sized boxes, somehow staying upright and avoiding the thousand other quick-weaving, horn-blasting scooters.

As I was watching all this, I had an idea. I know it was a good idea, because I can remember the giddy-silly excitement I felt after it hit me.

And then? I fucking _forgot it_.

When I got home, I could remember being excited, but I could _not_ remember what I had thought of.

In the span of maybe ten minutes, I lost an idea that I can _still_ remember really liking.

> Keeping a slow hunch alive poses challenges on multiple scales. [...] Most slow hunches never last long enough to turn into something useful, because they pass in and out of our memory too quickly[...]. You get a feeling that there’s an interesting avenue to explore, a problem that might someday lead you to a solution, but then you get distracted by more pressing matters and the hunch disappears. So part of the secret of hunch cultivation is simple: write everything down.

Had I taken a few seconds to put a note into my phone, I'd still have it. But I couldn't be bothered, and now I'm sans-idea.

## Trends from a Long Time Ago

Darwin was very good at taking notes. He had notebook after notebook filled with ideas, quotes, sketches, and whatever else came to mind as he wrote.

As Johnson argues, "it is not that the notebook is a mere transcription of the ideas[...]. Darwin was constantly rereading his notes, discovering new implications. his ideas emerge as a kind of duet between the present-tense thinking brain and all those past observations recorded on paper."

Darwin's note-taking was similar to a trendy seventeenth- and eighteenth-century practice called "[commonplacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)", which was essentially the act of writing down things that were interesting or inspiring, which often led to independent commentary and thought.

The commonplace book was less a journal or diary than a freeform record of passing thoughts, insights, and inspirations. It wasn't intended to be read in sequence, but rather to be dug into like a reference book.

The goal was to keep a written record of the transient thoughts that we catch and release each day, in hopes of preserving them beyond the limits of our own memories — giving us a better chance to find connections between our current ideas and those we've had before.

## How to Have Great Ideas

If I've had one Big Idea™ in my life so far, it's been the realization that my career and my income are _tools_ and not goals. My _goals_ are to live a life where I'm not obligated to do anything I haven't chosen to do; to have the personal and financial freedom to do the things that sound interesting to me; to live a life where every day I'm saying, "I can't imagine any way I'd rather be living right now."

That idea wasn't born whole. For anyone who's been reading along, I've slowly built this idea, starting in late 2013 when I realized how unhealthy my working situation was, gaining steam in early 2014 when I [wrote about my workaholism](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a), and maturing throughout 2015 as I've shifted into this new lifestyle.

In fact, if I look through my previous posts I can see:

* I was still [advocating 12-hour days]({{< ref "no-distractions-results.md" >}}) less than two years ago
* I was in the [nascent stages]({{< ref "too-busy.md" >}}) of [the ideas]({{< ref "better-productivity-work-less.md" >}}) that currently inform my style of working back in early 2014.
* I wrote several posts like [this one on magic]({{< ref "magic.md" >}}), in which I've _almost_ articulated a thought, but I'm still not able to fully explain what I was getting at.

Seeing these half-baked ideas, I can revisit them, and — as I apply new insight to old ideas — create something newer, and more fully formed.

## The Revolution Will Mostly Go Unnoticed

Taking notes is not a new idea. It's not a revolutionary idea. I'm not arguing that I've stumbled upon some deep secret of the universe.

However, taking notes _will_ improve your ability to track multiple ideas over longer periods of time.

And _that_ just might change everything.
