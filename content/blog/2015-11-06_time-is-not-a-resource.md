When we call time a resource, it implies that we can *do stuff* with it. And we talk about our time like that: protecting time, spending time, wasting time.

We talk about our time like it's a bank balance: "I only spend time on the things that *truly* add value to my life."

But fuck your sanctimonious proclamations, because no you don't. None of us do. Because _we don't **choose** to spend our time._

Time passes, whether we're choosing to spend it or not. I can't say, "Well, I only have three hours' worth of value-adding life scheduled for today, so I'll bank the additional twenty-one hours for later."

That's the fantasy that we seem to operate under, however — to varying degrees of self-inflicted damage.

## What If I'm Wasting Time on the Wrong Projects?

At breakfast a few days ago, Marisa and I were talking about her career transition over the last year, and the twists and turns she's dealt with along the way. There was a twinge of despair around the edges of the conversation, and when I poked at it[^poke] she started talking about time.

[^poke]:
    That's what you're supposed to do when you see that something is bothering someone, right? Poke at the sore spot?

"I worry that I've already wasted so much time. What if I start working on one of these ideas and it doesn't work? I'll be even further behind," she sighed, and gave me her best exasperated pout. "I just don't want to waste any more time going in the wrong direction."

For a brief, strange second I saw inside Marisa's mind.

> I'm in at the edge of a clearing ringed with orchids, a rainbow flowing through its center like a small stream. Near the edge, a unicorn drinks from the rainbow, glittering like David Bowie and humming ["Once Upon a Dream"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXbHShUnwxY). It spots me, and pointedly looks toward the mouth of the rainbow.
>
> I follow its gaze, and I see a teal lake at the foot of a mountain. At the mouth of the rainbow, a mermaid with an explosion of curls stands guard, and I realize that the mountain isn't a mountain at all, but magical sand from a magical hourglass — Marisa's time.
>
> As I draw closer, the mermaid bristles and booms, "HEY. BACK THE FUCK UP. I'M PROTECTING THIS TIME."

This was a *Holy Shit, Obviously* moment for me. Marisa — and I, and probably everyone else ever — was looking at time all wrong.

## A Shift in the Realities of Time

So, let's get deep(ly unscientific) for a minute and talk about time, as it exists in our current realities.

Time flows through a mysterious hole in the universe, originating from a much-debated wellspring just beyond our comprehension. Time rains down upon us from the fourth dimension or whatever, and we're all given the opportunity to use a finite amount of it.

And that's where the fundamental misunderstanding comes in.

### How we think time works.

There's a delusion that, with a bucket, we can store time. We say things like, "I don't want to spend my time that way," and imagine ourselves catching those few hours in a jar, to be spent later.

We picture it as a liquid, like water, that can be dammed, captured, stoppered, stored, labeled, and consumed at a later date.

Over time, the most temporally responsible among us will boast shelves upon shelves of bottled time, waiting for the right time to spend our carefully stockpiled time. Aging it, so to speak.

### How time really works.

A better analogy for time is sunlight. Or wind.

The world spins, and depending on where we stand on it, we get so much sunlight during the day. And if it's a windy day, the wind blows.

We can't store it. There's no bottle-aged sunshine. You can't crack open a can of Blustery October Morning on a stifling July afternoon.

Time, like sunlight and wind, is a linear, nontransferable resource. It happens once, and then it's over. **Time passes and is lost, whether you had something valuable to spend it on or not.**

## The Two Possible Outcomes of Passing Time

With time's impermanence in mind, the idea that you can "waste time" by working on "the wrong ideas" is ridiculous.

Time will pass, whether or not you're working on something.

The passing of time can provide two outcomes:

1. You receive new information about the world and where you currently fit best in it.
2. You receive no new information.

In one of these situations, we're putting time to work for us. In the other, we're letting time pass — often under the pretense of "focusing only on what matters" — and gaining nothing.

### Outcome #1: You receive new information about the world.

If you work on any idea — even the "wrong" ones — you will receive new information:

- "Turns out I don't really like sales. I don't want to do that anymore."
- "I really enjoyed working with my hands when I took that woodworking class. I should do more of that."
- "I thought marine biologists just played with dolphins! Why am I scraping fish shit off an aquarium floor?"

This information can be used to refine how your remaining time is spent.

### Outcome #2: You receive no new information about the world.

If you "guard" your time by waiting until you have "the right idea" to work on, what you're *actually* doing is thoroughly and totally wasting time.

_You're still out the same amount of time as if you'd worked on something else, except in this case you've learned nothing._

## Use Your Time Now, Because You Can't Use It Later

Our time is not like our bank balance. We can't live frugally and accrue tons of time that we can spend later in life on things we enjoy.

Rather, we're born with a set amount of time, and each day we lose 24 hours of it.

When you refuse to start on something because you're worried you might waste your time on it, you manage to both a) irrevocably waste your time, and b) make no progress toward figuring out what "the right idea" may be.

## Pull the Trigger on New Projects and Learn Something

If we choose to sit and wait for "the right ideas" to come to us, we might wait an awfully long time. However, if you're constantly working on something — even if it might be wrong — you can find the right ideas much more quickly.

So if you find yourself wanting to hold off on a new project because you're worried it might be a waste of time, ask yourself two questions:

1. If I do this, will it prevent me from spending time on something that I *know* is more important to me?
2. If not, what would I do with this time instead?

If you're not starting a new project at the expense of something valuable to you, then the initial fear of "misspent time" is irrelevant — you don't have a better place to allocate this time.[^thinking]

[^thinking]:
    "Trying to come up with a better use of my time," is not a valid excuse.

And if you don't start this new project — and you don't have something more valuable to spend your time on — where will your time go instead? Idle "research" on social media? Reading yet another article about finding your passion[^fyp] or being more productive?[^productive] Some other clever disguise for _completely_ wasting time?

[^fyp]:
    "I used to be miserable, just like you, until I found my passion, which is helping other people find their passion. You should buy my ebook on finding your passion so you, too, can find your passion — which is probably selling ebooks to other people about finding their passion."<br><br>(Sass notwithstanding, I do think you should [do what you love]({{< ref "blog/do-what-you-love.md" >}}).)

[^productive]:
    Productivity is important. I [talk about productivity]({{< ref "blog/scheduling-maximum-productivity.md" >}}) frequently. But there's a point where productivity research is like turning down sex because you're too busy masturbating.

### There is no better way to spend your time than by gaining experience.

Don't worry about wasting time. It's spent no matter what.

**Instead, worry about _using time_.** Make sure the time that passes results in new information and new experiences.

So go start that project that might be doomed. Chase that idea that you can't imagine making money. It's certainly more temporally responsible than letting that time pass unused.

And — hey — you might just learn something.
