What I'm wearing, updated after 9 months on the road.

### Clothing

- 6 American Apparel t-shirts (black)
- 2 pair AG shorts (grey and navy)
- 1 pair AG pants (grey)
- 6 pair Diesel boxer briefs (various colors)
- 6 pair Timberland no-show socks (black)

Simple, black t-shirts are easy to find, inexpensive, and they look nice. Plus, they don't stand out enough that someone would think, "Isn't that guy wearing the same clothes from yesterday?"

American Apparel has stores everywhere, which affords me a small bit of consistency. 

### Shoes

- 1 pair Nike Free 5.0 (black)
- 1 pair Vans Authentic (black)
- 1 pair Reef flip flops (brown)

I tried to ditch the Nikes, and — in a tragic string of poor decisions — I ended up purchasing and hating three other pairs of shoes. None of them were as comfortable as the Frees, or as versatile.

The Vans Authentic are great because they're simple enough to go with shorts or swim trunks, but they can be dressed up enough to work with my sportcoat.

I used to have Ariat work boots, but they took up a shitload of space. I miss those boots, though, and I think I'll *really* miss them the next time we end up somewhere chilly.

### Accessories

- 1 Bonobos woven belt (light grey) — https://bonobos.com/products/striped-web-belt?color=khaki%20and%20navy
- 2 Jack Spade watches (black/black, orange/grey)
- 1 Citizen EcoDrive watch (silver)
- 1 pair Salt glasses
- 1 pair Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses
- 1 snapback cap from Willet Distillery
- 1 shitty paper hat from a street stall

My watches are an indulgence; I definitely *don't* need three of them. But since they don't take up much space, I try not to stress about it.

Sunglasses and a hat are critical when you spend most of your time in hot climates. I feel like I look silly in all hats — plus a hat is bound to get sweaty when it's blisteringly hot outside — so I just grab cheap ones that I won't worry about when they get gross and/or fall apart.

### Outerwear

- 1 Jack Spade cotton jacket
- 1 By Robert James topcoat
- 1 Giorgio Armani sportcoat

With as much time as I spend in warm climates, these coats often feel like dead weight. However, when they're needed, they feel like a lifesaver.

The cotton jacket is perfect for cool weather and damp weather. The topcoat can handle pretty chilly weather (February in London was no problem) and I really love the way it looks — even though I rarely need it, it's hard to let it go.

The sportcoat is very lightweight, so it serves as a way to dress up an outfit even in warm weather. Any time we go to a nice restaurant or I have a public speaking gig, I'm likely wearing this.

### Activewear

- 1 pair Adidas swim trunks
- 1 pair Nike workout shorts

To save space, I wear my t-shirt from the day before[^smell-test] to the gym. The workout shorts can be washed in the sink and dried quickly.

    Provided it passes the smell test, of course.
