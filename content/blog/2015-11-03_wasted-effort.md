In high school I thought I wanted to be a rockstar. In the process of pursuing that goal, I managed to drop out of college, become more or less unemployable, ruin most of my relationships, and — ultimately — fail to become a rockstar.

It would be easy to call 2004–2007 "wasted time".

But then again, I also learned some things:

- most of making it as a band is managing a business, and I like the business part
- I like design, and I built experience creating posters and t-shirts
- I like building websites[^websites]
- I'm pretty okay at sales and marketing
- I can get by with little or no income[^broke]
- I definitely prefer having an income

[^websites]:
    I kicked off the early stages of my freelancing career by trying to scrape together food money as a touring musician. I customized a couple MySpace pages, built websites for my band and a few friends' bands. This was also the period during which I built [Nate's](http://thenategreenexperience.com) first website, and got hired for my very first paying gigs.

[^broke]:
    For a while, I lived off about $60/month (enough to cover my cell phone bill, earned by working for a week or so in a minimum wage job that I knew wouldn't call my references) and the charity of others. I'd ask for a place to stay onstage, and usually someone would offer up a living room to the band. Other times we'd sleep in Walmart parking lots or on sticky venue floors. We ate a lot of dollar menu fast food.

Beyond that, I learned to [trust myself in unfamiliar situations]({{< ref "blog/set-yourself-on-fire.md" >}}).

**I learned that I could figure things out in the absence of other options.** There was no chance in hell my band could afford a graphic designer or a web developer. My choices were to figure out how to do it myself, or make do without tour posters, merchandise, or a website.

**I learned that I enjoyed hard challenges.** Despite the frustration and near-hopelessness of it, I found that I deeply enjoyed the attempt at taking an unknown, generally unimpressive entity (my emo band) and trying to get people to support us with downloads and dollars.

## The Skills We Learn Cross Over to Other Areas

Every single one of those skills has served me in the time since my band broke up.

1. Convincing someone to buy an album or a t-shirt is a lot like selling web design or consulting services.
2. Demanding payment from a broke promoter when my choices were A) collect $100 for gas money, or B) I live in Tucson now — that was a great primer for following up on overdue invoices.

Most obviously, learning to customize my band's MySpace page *laid the foundation for what I do for a living today*.[^myspace]

[^myspace]:
    That's right: I owe my career to MySpace. (MySpace was the Facebook of yore, for the youngins.)

In light of that, it's hard to call my rockstar days "wasted time". Instead, **my "wasted" time was more of a roundabout discovery process**, during which I learned about things I liked and/or was good at (e.g. business, design, [travel]({{< ref "blog/remote-work-travel.md" >}}), challenging environments), and things I didn't like so much and/or was terrible at (e.g. singing and playing an instrument, living in a van, wearing eyeliner).

## If You're Learning, No Time Is Wasted

From all this, I've realized that looking at anything productive as "wasted time" is a serious error.

Life is a process of discovery. We start with a tiny spark of consciousness and *absolutely no fucking idea what is going on elsewhere*. Over years of experience, we chip away at the mysteries of life, learning what things make us happy, what things make us sad; what things we care about, and what things don't matter.

**Every new project — foolish, doomed, or otherwise — furthers that discovery process.** Every time we follow through[^follow-through] on a new venture, we can add to the pro/con lists that inform our decision-making processes, and our lives become a little (or a lot) better for the experience.

[^follow-through]:
    The follow-through is critical, here. Starting and abandoning something before we learn anything doesn't do anyone any good.

## Fail Fast, Learn More, Become Better

The tech crowd encourages new entrepreneurs to "fail fast" — this is what they're talking about: try something, learn, and apply that knowledge to the next thing.

Gaining experience of *any kind* is a step further away from, "I have no idea what I want to do with my life," and a step closer to, "I'm still not sure what I want to do with my life, but I'm certain of a few things I *don't* want to do with it."

Because even a bad experience is still experience, and **it's just as critical to know where _not_ to step** as you're moving forward.
