Every time I learn something new, I fall into a trap. It doesn't matter that I know the trap is there — I get caught every time.

There are four stages of learning, according to a theory developed by [Noel Burch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence):

1. **Unconscious Incompetence.** We're bad at something (rock climbing, speaking German, math) but we have no awareness of it. This is the "ignorance is bliss" stage of learning.
2. **Conscious Incompetence.** We're made aware that we are bad at something. This is sometimes the part where a person decides, "I hate ________", and chooses to never participate in this activity again.
3. **Conscious Competence.** Practice and high levels of concentratrion means we are now capable of performing this thing. This is how I feel about Spanish, or [regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/).
4. **Unconscious Competence.** Also known as mastery, where we can perform the thing without thinking about it. Things like walking and speaking our native language fall in this category pretty early on.

These stages are pretty widely discussed, and the reading makes for a pretty fascinating glimpse into human learning.

But these stages don't hold the trap.

## An Alternative Learning Progression

The trap lurks inside a different progression — one that [Nate](http://thenategreenexperience.com) and I noticed as we've observed our own behavior while learning:

1. **Clueless and Happy.** I have no idea that I'm stupid.[^ninety-nine]
2. **Self-Conscious and Defensive.** I am now aware that I'm stupid, and I'm pissed off that you pointed it out.
3. **Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending.** I have become exactly knowledgeable enough to fake that I know what I'm talking about. I will now make sure everyone around me enters Stage 2 regarding this subject.
4. **Experienced and Unconcerned.** I know the topic well enough that I don't feel the need to assert my knowledge on anyone else.

[^ninety-nine]:
    This is the stage I'm currently in for roughly 99% of everything there is to know. It's on my bucket list to get that number down to 98% before I die.

At drinks earlier this year with the Precision Nutrition team in Toronto, I put the stages another way to CEO Phil Caravaggio:

## The Knowledge Trap

In mid-2014 I knew nothing about world travel — full-on _Clueless and Happy_. I'd taken two short European vacations, during which I'd been to Ireland and the UK twice, plus a couple days spent in Amsterdam and Belgium.[^english] Outside of those two trips, my only travel outside the US had been a couple teenaged beer runs to Calgary and a Vancouver conference weekend.

[^english]:
    Worth noting is that I avoided any country where English wasn't basically a first language.

But I had just made a commitment to [spend a year outside the United States]({{< ref "blog/remote-work-travel.md" >}}), and I found myself propelled into _Self-Conscious and Defensive_. Naturally, I'd run my mouth off about the trip to almost everyone I knew, so they all had questions, and I wanted to punch every curious friend in the throat for drawing attention to my lack of answers.

In the months between booking my ticket and boarding the plane, I read everything I could find by other travelers to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I knew I'd need practical knowledge eventually, but I was happy to build a theoretical base in the meantime.

The more I read, the more confident I became. I eased into _Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending_ like a comfortably broken-in pair of shoes.

I was in the trap. Again.

Armed with research, I unleashed an awareness campaign on everyone unfortunate enough to fall within earshot.

"[Travel is cheaper than a lease]({{< ref "cost-of-living.md" >}})," I cried from my soapbox. "It's easier than ever to [become location independent]({{< ref "blog/how-to-become-location-independent.md" >}})! Don't you understand? [_Remote work is the future!_]({{< ref "blog/remote-work-everyone-wins.md" >}}) You have to [stop overworking or you're going to die](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a)!"

    You know what's fun? Carrying everything you own with you at all times!

And I didn't care that most people don't want to sell everything and live like nomadic hermit crabs, because I was galvanized by how un-fucking-believably _correct_ I was.[^discourse]

[^discourse]:
    **How to solve all the world's problems, by Jason Lengstorf:**<br><br>The problem with public discourse today — about politics, books, music, or whatever — is that most of us spend the majority of our time caught in the _Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending_ stage of learning.<br><br>There's just Too Much Stuff™ to know, so we comfort ourselves by knowing a little bit. And knowing a little bit _is_ better than knowing nothing.<br><br>_Unless knowing a little bit somehow convinces us that we know everything and should be considered experts when the time for important decisions arises._<br><br>But because we all know a little, we're convinced of our Unbearable Rightness, and we either shout into an echo chamber of other people who have the same limited knowledge and who agree with us because they, too, are Unbearably Right; or we hit the brick wall of an opposing opinion that, like us, has limited information — _different_ limited information — and is similarly convinced of its Incontrovertible Correctness.<br><br>The American media today is a great real-world example of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object: shit goes sideways.<br><br>There are no experts anymore, because we burn them at the stake for questioning our Unbearable Rightness. Instead we sink to partially-informed mob justice because our tiny bit of knowledge convinces us that we, too, have Valuable Opinions, and since we our Valuable Opinions stem from Unbearable Rightness, the experts are clearly in the pocket of Big Wrong and we can safely ignore them.<br><br>There is no discourse anymore. There are only the Unbearably Right and the Incontrovertibly Correct, and neither side seems willing to do further research to recognize that — just maybe — we're all working toward the same goals from different ends of the spectrum, and if we finished reading that book that got us started on that Twitter rant, maybe we'd realize that both viewpoints arrive at semi-compatible conclusions.<br><br>Where public discourse would really benefit is from the semi-informed — which is you and me in roughly 99% of issues being discussed — should just _shut the fuck up_ and listen to people who have dedicated their lives to learning the things being discussed.<br><br>If we're talking about software or travel or small businesses, I have lots of fairly well-informed opinions. But I don't know that I could even explain what macroeconomics _is_, let alone make informed choices about what's best for global trade.<br><br>Macroeconomics has something to do with global trade, right? I'm making that assumption because "macro" means big, and global trade is also big. I refuse to look this up because I think it's doing a pretty good job of demonstrating my point right now.<br><br>I want my opinion to matter. But sometimes it doesn't. And as much as it pains me to admit it, sometimes I need to sit quietly and let someone more knowledgeable do what's best — or start studying hard so I can make an _informed_ contribution.

## Holy Shit, Obviously {#holy-shit-obviously}

My reign of terror as an advocate of the travel lifestyle that I had only just discovered was the symptom of what I call the _Holy Shit, Obviously_ moment.

**The Holy Shit, Obviously moment occurs when we realize something, then can't believe how we possibly never realized it before, and immediately look with derision toward others who have not had our realization from a few seconds earlier.**

I had my Holy Shit, Obviously moment with travel, and I felt immediately superior to everyone around me who didn't know how great travel was — the same way I hadn't known how great travel was until the week before.

## Climbing Out of the Trap

It's been roughly a year since I started traveling, and most of the glitter has washed off at this point. I don't look at travel as being an indicator of whether or not someone is enlightened — that's something the embarrassingly elitist me from a few months back would think.

Instead, I look at travel the way I used to look at living in Portland vs. living in Montana: some people prefer cities because they like food, walkability, more people, or whatever; some people prefer small towns because they like knowing everyone they pass on the street, quiet nights with incredible starry skies, and mowing lawns, and tending gardens without paying for a shared space in an urban gardeners' collective.

Some people find travel exciting and rewarding. Others find it stressful and draining.

Neither group is wrong. There's no such thing as an incorrect personal preference — what _is_ wrong is trying to force my personal preferences down someone else's throat.

And that's where the trap is so hard to escape. When I was first getting excited about travel, I couldn't imagine a world where someone _wouldn't_ be excited about it. And that excitement makes me forceful with my opinions.

## We Don't Need Consensus

Travel was the latest in a long line of knowledge traps I've fallen into and dragged myself out of ashamed. For a while I was convinced that only metal music was pure music and people like Justin Timberlake were everything that was wrong with the world.[^jt] I was once strongly in favor of robot government. For a while I [got evangelical on my dad about coffee]({{< ref "blog/taste-doesnt-matter.md">}}).

[^jt]:
    I don't feel that way anymore, JT. I think you're a goddamned genius and I think we should hang out.

In every case, once I reached the _Experienced and Unconcerned_ phase, I realized that it just doesn't matter. The thing I know works for me, whether or not anyone else agrees.

In the _Marginally Informed and Wholly Condescending_ stage, it's easy to start looking at our new ideas as necessary or non-negotiable. But that's less because the idea is _actually_ vital — remember, in my case I lived twenty-nine years ignorant of the travel lifestyle that I excoriated other people for their ignorance of — and more because we're desperately trying to assure ourselves that this new obsession is a good thing.

I need you to buy into my travel obsession because I need group acceptance to make it okay for me to believe this. I don't want to be crazy.[^honey]

[^honey]:
    If I found out that rubbing honey on my balls made me happy, I would want everyone else to rub honey on their junk, too. I'd tell myself it was because I wanted them to be as happy as I was, but in reality I'd need other people to approve of my application of honey — otherwise I'm just a weirdo with sticky business.

## Short-Circuit the Cycle

I still don't know how to skip the insufferable asshole part of learning something new. If you figure it out, let me know — after you've gotten over the insufferable asshole part of figuring it out, that is.

But I try to be more aware of what I'm doing now. I try to withhold my opinion in conversations until I'm asked for it. I try to catch the derision before it forms a smirk when someone does something I don't agree with.

It hasn't cured me — I mean, shit, I was probably condescending within this post about trying not to be condescending — but the people who've known me longest _have_ commented that I suck a little less to talk to these days.

And I'll call that a win.
