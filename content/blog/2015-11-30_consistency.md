In the decade or so I've worked as a web designer, developer, and marketer, I've helped somewhere north of 300 clients put together online businesses and personal brands.

Of these clients, many went on to build incredible success. One of my earliest clients, John Romaniello, has gone on to build a seven-figure business since we first started discussing a brand overhaul in 2007.

Another, Matt McGorry, built a Hollywood career for himself as Officer Bennett on _Orange Is The New Black_.[^no-credit]

[^no-credit]:
    I had nothing to do with that. Matt hired me to help with his personal training business, which had very little to do with Matt's success, other than ensuring he was in great shape when it came time to show his bare ass on camera.

Dozens of other clients went on to build large online followings and comfortable incomes.

Unfortunately, some didn't. Some of my clients struggled along until they couldn't justify the cost of keeping their businesses open any longer. Others barely keep their heads above water and chase business month to month so they can keep the lights on.

**What's the difference between the person who makes it and the person who barely scrapes by, or ends up quitting?**

## There Is No Real Difference Between Competitors

When I was still at Copter Labs, nearly all of our clients were in the fitness industry. And in the fitness industry, there's not all that much variation in the experts.

On the surface, almost every fitness personality is:

1. In great shape
2. More knowledgeable than the average person about getting healthy
3. Looking to work with clients to improve their health

There are lots of nuances and small differences: some people focus on movement, others strength, or diet, and there are thousands of variations on each of those themes.

But to the uninitiated — the people who have never thought about health and fitness beyond the quarterly weigh-in and occasional impulse purchase of a _Tae Bo®_ video — there is no difference between CrossFit and powerlifting. There's no difference between Paleo and Atkins. It's all "healthy stuff", and that's about as far as their consideration goes.

### Positioning is great, but it won't save your business.

My clients always stressed small differentiators to me: "I do functional strength training with a focus on primal movement and mobility"; "My clients get strong and lean through classic weight training and ketogenic diets"; "I call my style of training 'Wolfeo', and my clients do high-intensity bursts of cardio (chasing prey) followed by endurance strength training (dismembering prey) supplemented by a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate raw diet (fresh deer meat)."

But no matter what the variation, to an outsider the offering was the same: _you'll move a little more, eat a little better, and by doing so you'll lose weight and start to look and feel better._

To the vast majority of people who haven't thought about health or fitness, all of my clients' businesses are ostensibly the same. Minor differences in their branding will attract one demographic and deter another, but the opportunity is more or less the same for each client.

## So Why Do Some People Struggle While Others Flourish?
