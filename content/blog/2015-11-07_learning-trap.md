Every time I learn something new, I fall into a trap. It doesn't matter that I know the trap is there — I get caught every time.

I love learning. I want to know everything. I believe curiosity is what will eventually fix all the world's problems. When I meet new people, I consider their curiosity as the biggest factor in whether or not I want to spend more time around them.

However, having said all that, there's a problem: my curiosity and learning has an unintended side effect that I can't seem to shake: learning new things has the tendency to (temporarily[^i-hope]) turn me into a gaping asshole.

[^i-hope]:
    At least I hope it's only temporary. If I'm _always_ a gaping asshole, please give me a heads up at... no, actually, you know what? I don't think I can handle that kind of real talk.

## The Standard Learning Progression

First, some background: there are four stages of learning, according to a [theory developed by Noel Burch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence):

1. **Unconscious Incompetence.** We're bad at something (rock climbing, speaking German, math) but we have no awareness of it. This is the "ignorance is bliss" part.
2. **Conscious Incompetence.** We're made aware that we are bad at something. This is the birthplace of the statement, "I hate ________ because it's stupid and anyone who disagrees with me is also stupid."[^everything-im-not-good-at-is-dumb]
3. **Conscious Competence.** Practice and high levels of concentration means we are now capable of performing this thing. This is how I feel about Spanish, or [regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/).
4. **Unconscious Competence.** Also known as mastery, where we can perform the thing without thinking about it. Things like walking and speaking our native language fall in this category pretty early on.

[^everything-im-not-good-at-is-dumb]:
    At this point, I typically choose never to participate in this activity again and adopt an air of smug superiority while publicly deriding it.

This is a generally-agreed-upon representation of the learning process, and they've been discussed widely, and by people much smarter than me.

But these stages don't hold the trap, so I won't talk about them here.

## The New Learning Progression, Adjusted for My Shitty Attitude

The trap lurks inside a different progression — one that [Nate](http://thenategreenexperience.com) and I noticed as we've observed our own behavior while learning:

1. **Clueless and Happy.** I have no idea that I'm stupid.[^ninety-nine]
2. **Self-Conscious and Defensive.** I am now aware that I'm stupid, and I'm pissed off that you pointed it out.
3. **Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending.** _(a.k.a. The Learning Trap.)_ I have become exactly knowledgeable enough to fake that I know what I'm talking about. I will now see to it, in a condescending, self-congratulatory manner, that everyone around me enters Stage 2 regarding this subject.
4. **Experienced and Unconcerned.** I know the topic well enough that I don't feel the need to assert my knowledge on anyone else.

[^ninety-nine]:
    This is the stage I'm currently in for roughly 99% of everything there is to know. It's on my bucket list to get that number down to 98% before I die.

Over drinks earlier this year with the Precision Nutrition team in Toronto, I put the stages another way to CEO Phil Caravaggio:

## The Knowledge Trap

In mid-2014 I knew nothing about world travel — full-on _Clueless and Happy_. I'd taken two short European vacations, during which I'd been to Ireland and the UK twice, plus a couple days spent in Amsterdam and Belgium.[^english] Outside of those two trips, my only travel outside the US had been a couple teenaged beer runs to Calgary.

[^english]:
    Worth noting is that I avoided any country where English wasn't basically a first language.

But I had just made a commitment to [spend a year outside the United States]({{< ref "blog/remote-work-travel.md" >}}), and I found myself propelled into _Self-Conscious and Defensive_.

Naturally, I'd run my mouth off about the trip to almost everyone I knew. People asked questions, and I wanted to punch every curious friend in the throat for drawing attention to my lack of answers.

In the months between booking my ticket and boarding the plane, I read everything I could find by other travelers to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I knew I'd need practical knowledge eventually, but I was happy to build a theoretical base in the meantime.

The more I read, the more confident I became. I eased into _Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending_ like a comfortably broken-in pair of shoes.[^dunning-kruger]

[^dunning-kruger]:
    There's some research supporting this. The [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) describes the overconfidence felt by people with low competence. If you're borderline incompetent, you're prone to overestimate your own skill. You're also more likely to dismiss the expertise of others.

I was in the trap. Again.

Armed with research, I unleashed an awareness campaign on everyone unfortunate enough to fall within earshot.

"[Travel is cheaper than a lease]({{< ref "cost-of-living.md" >}})," I cried from my high horse. "It's easier than ever to [become location independent]({{< ref "blog/how-to-become-location-independent.md" >}})! Don't you understand? [_Remote work is the future!_]({{< ref "blog/remote-work-everyone-wins.md" >}}) You have to [stop overworking or you're going to die](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a)!"

And I didn't care that most people don't have any interest in selling everything they can't carry and living like a nomadic hermit crab, because I was galvanized by how un-fucking-believably _correct_ I was.[^discourse]

[^discourse]:
    **How to solve all the world's problems, by Jason Lengstorf:**<br><br>The breakdown in public discourse today — about politics, books, music, or whatever — happens because most of us spend the majority of our time permanently mired in the _Marginally Capable and Wholly Condescending_ stage of learning.<br><br>There's just Too Much Stuff™ to know, so we comfort ourselves by knowing a little bit. And knowing a little bit _is_ better than knowing nothing.<br><br>_Unless knowing a little bit somehow convinces us that we know everything and should be considered experts when the time for important decisions arises._<br><br>But because we all know a little, we're convinced of our Unquestionable Rightness, and we either shout into an echo chamber of other people who have the same limited knowledge and who agree with us because they, too, are Unquestionably Right; or we hit the brick wall of an opposing opinion that, like us, has (different) limited information and is similarly convinced of its Incontrovertible Correctness.<br><br>The American media today is a great real-world example of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object: shit goes sideways.<br><br>There are no experts anymore, because we burn them at the stake for questioning our Unquestionable Rightness.

There are only the Unquestionably Right and the Incontrovertibly Correct, and neither side seems willing to do further research to recognize that maybe — just maybe — we're all working toward the same goals from different ends of the spectrum, and if we were to actually read the article attached to that headline that launched our most recent Twitter rant, we might realize both viewpoints arrive at somewhat compatible conclusions.<br><br>Where public discourse would really benefit is if the semi-informed — which is you and me in roughly 99% of issues being discussed — would just _shut the fuck up_ and listen to people who have dedicated their lives to learning the things being discussed.<br><br>If we're talking about software or travel or small businesses, I have lots of fairly well-informed opinions.

I'm making that assumption because "macro" means big, and global trade is also big. I refuse to look this up because I think it's doing a pretty good job of demonstrating my point right now.<br><br>I want my opinion to matter. But sometimes it doesn't. And as much as it pains me to admit it, sometimes I need to sit quietly and let someone more knowledgeable do what's best — or start studying hard so I can make an _informed_ contribution.

## Holy Shit, Obviously {#holy-shit-obviously}

My reign of terror as an advocate of the travel lifestyle that I had only just discovered was the symptom of what I call the _Holy Shit, Obviously_ moment.

**The Holy Shit, Obviously moment occurs when we realize something, then can't believe how we possibly never realized it before, and immediately look with derision toward others who have not had our realization from a few seconds earlier.**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8:02: Learn new information.&#10;8:07: Overhear discussion re: new information.&#10;8:08: Condescendingly offer opinion formed six minutes earlier.</p>&mdash; Jason Lengstorf (@jlengstorf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/674980634490626049">December 10, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I had my Holy Shit, Obviously moment with travel, and I felt immediately superior to everyone around me who didn't know how great travel was — the same way I hadn't known how great travel was until the week before.

## Climbing Out of the Trap

It's been roughly a year since I started traveling; most of the glitter has washed off at this point. I don't look at travel as an indicator of whether or not someone is enlightened anymore — that's something my embarrassingly elitist self from a year ago would think.

Instead, I look at travel the way I used to look at living in Portland vs. living in Montana: some people prefer cities because they like food, walkability, more people, or whatever; some people prefer small towns because they like knowing everyone they pass on the street, quiet nights with incredible starry skies, and tending gardens without paying for a shared space in an urban gardeners' collective.

Some people find travel exciting and rewarding. Others find it stressful and draining.

Neither group is wrong. **There's no such thing as an incorrect personal preference — what _is_ wrong is trying to force a personal preferences down someone else's throat.**

And that's where the trap is so hard to escape. When I was first getting excited about travel, I couldn't imagine a world where someone _wouldn't_ be excited about it. And that excitement made me forceful with my opinions.

## We Don't Need Consensus

Travel was the latest in a long line of knowledge traps I've fallen into and dragged myself out of, dirty and ashamed. In high school I was convinced metal was the only _real_ music,[^filth] and people like Justin Timberlake were everything that was wrong with the world.[^jt] I was once strongly in favor of robot government. For a while I [went evangelical on my dad about coffee]({{< ref "blog/taste-doesnt-matter.md">}}).

[^filth]:
    "Seriously, bro, you haven't heard _true_ musical genius until you've heard Danny Filth wax romantic about disembowelment in a falsetto shriek."

[^jt]:
    I don't feel that way anymore, JT. We should hang out.

In the _Marginally Informed and Wholly Condescending_ stage, it's easy to start looking at our new ideas as necessary or non-negotiable. But that's less because the idea is _actually_ vital — after all, I lived twenty-nine years blissfully ignorant of the travel lifestyle before I started excoriating others for their ignorance — and more because we're desperately trying to assure ourselves that this new obsession is a good thing.

I need you to buy into my travel obsession because I need group acceptance to make it okay for me to believe this. I don't want to be crazy.[^honey]

[^honey]:
    If I found out that rubbing honey on my balls made me happy, I would want everyone else to rub honey on their business, too. I'd tell myself it was because I wanted them to be as happy as I was, but in reality I'd need other people to approve of my non-standard application of honey — otherwise I'm just a weirdo with sticky junk.

But with experience — reaching the _Experienced and Unconcerned_ stage — I realized in every case that **consensus of opinion just doesn't matter.** The thing I like works for me — whether or not anyone else agrees.

## Short-Circuit the Cycle

I still don't know how to skip the insufferable asshole part of learning something new. If you figure it out, let me know — after you've gotten over the insufferable asshole part of figuring it out, that is.

But I try to be more aware of what I'm doing now. I try to withhold my opinion in conversations until I'm asked for it. I try to catch the derision before it forms a smirk when someone does something I don't fully understand.

It hasn't cured me — I mean, shit, I was probably condescending within this post about trying not to be condescending — but the people who've known me longest _have_ commented that I suck a little less to talk to these days.

And I'll call that a win.
