I was nineteen or twenty, working at a pizza place for this really nice guy named Rick. I was a manager, sort of. I worked six hour shifts, three or four days a week, and I'd be the last one to close the restaurant, count the till, and drop off the day's earnings at the bank.

The employees at Stageline Pizza came in three flavors: people so dim and solipsistic it's surprising they survived to adulthood; people shipwrecked by their own bad decisions or the bad decisions of others, doing what they could to get by; and occasionally someone really bright came through just for a month or so, before trading up to something better.

I lived with a fierce desire to be the latter, fueled by a gripping terror that I landed firmly in categories one and two.

My time at Stageline came during my rockstar phase, and I'd regularly ask Rick to give me two weeks or more off work so I could go on tour. Rick obliged, being a really nice guy.

And I'd come back to work, leaking PBR from my pores and still wearing smudged eyeliner, and put in my three or four shifts for another couple weeks before asking for more time off.

---

It was after the second tour, or maybe the third, when I came home to find a letter in my room from Rick, sent in an official Stageline envelope. There was no note inside; just a pink slip.

What injustice! What cruelty! What cowardice!

I hated Rick. No, not Rick. Rick was a really nice guy. It was _his wife!_ _She_ made him fire me. And actually fuck Rick, too, because he didn't stick up for me.

_The world is a cold place,_ I reminded myself. _You can't count on anyone but yourself._

My wisdom comforted me. I threw the pink slip away and wondered how much longer it would take for my last paycheck to show up in the mail.

---

Getting fired was just the latest in an ever-growing series of events where the world shit on me. Everything I touched, it seemed, either fell apart or actively set out to hurt me.

I was cursed, or the world was broken. I took equal parts comfort and exasperation in knowing I was the only sane human. Like, _in the whole world_. Everyone else _had_ to be crazy — that was the only way I could explain how terrible everything was.

I made it my mission to let everyone know about it. If I was going to be made a victim, at the very least I'd be an unpleasantly loud one.

A cycle started: I'd try my hand at something new, it would inevitably fall apart, and I would — retroactively — see how forces had conspired against me from the very start to ensure I'd fail.

I had the Antimidas Touch.

I was doomed.

Resignation crept in and started whispering in a conspiratorial, drug-dealery way, "Hey, man, you want the easy way out? All you gotta do is let me take over."

Stageline Pizza was part of a string of menial jobs I worked in hopes of landing a single paycheck before I quit or got fired and went on tour with my band again.

At another one of these jobs — another pizza place — I worked with an older guy, Dave. Dave was a Lifer.[^lifer] He'd been a line cook since the restaurant opened, happily putting in his shifts and occasionally buying beer for the underaged dishwashers. He was funny and cheerful and he loved *The String Cheese Incident* and made us listen to their countless live recordings as if we liked the band and could tell performances apart.

[^lifer]:
    It's always hard to tell if a Lifer is doing this job because they truly enjoy it and can't imagine another way to make a living, or if they just started working here first and decided, "This is good enough," and never gave it a second thought, like the pioneers who stopped halfway to California and decided, "Fuck it. It probably doesn't get any better than this, and anyways my feet hurt. Let's call this place Nebraska and plant corn."

At this stage in my life, I was listening to shit like Slipknot and Coal Chamber. I was humorless and angry and growing steadily more convinced that I would never find happiness or success, thanks in no small part to my curse.

Dave — whether out of an earnest desire to help, or simply to fuck with me — would talk to me during our shifts.

"What's wrong, my man? You always look so put out," he'd ask as he stirred a ten-gallon vat of tomato sauce.

I'd glower at him as I weighed out five-ounce dough balls and rolled them. "It's all fucked, Dave. Everything I touch turns to shit."

And Dave chuckled a little, looked at me with a glint of something like pity, and — after a dramatic pause — launched into a joke:

> A man walks into the doctor's office and says, "Doctor, something is really wrong with me."
>
> The man taps his knee and says, "This hurts."
>
> He taps his shoulder — "This hurts too!" — then his head, and complains, "And this — I hurt everywhere!"
>
> The doctor nods thoughtfully. "I think I know what's wrong with you," he says, after a pause. "Your finger's broken."

I assumed Dave was high again, and chose not to engage him further.

---

It would be years before I'd learn what Dave was getting at.

Rick didn't fire me because he was a coward or a mean person; he fired me because I was shitty employee abusing his kindness.

When I started a new project under the assumption that it was doomed, I'd subtly nudge it toward failure.

When I met new people and decided they hated me,[^new-people] I'd keep my guard up and make sure we never had the chance to become friends.

[^new-people]:
    And since they hated me, it was safe to pre-hate them. Not because they'd done anything, but because they _would_ do something. Eventually.

So, sure, everything I touched _did_ turn to shit — but only because I worked to ensure things turned out shittily.

As I write this, it's about mid-morning in Whitefish, Montana. Dave is probably stirring a ten-gallon vat of tomato sauce, listening to *The String Cheese Incident*, and making cheerful conversation with a sullen teenager.

I don't know if he told me the broken finger joke as a roundabout teachable moment, or if my complaining about a cursed touch simply called it to mind.

I don't know if it matters; I missed the point when he told me, anyways.

I'm a few years late, Dave. But I get it now.

*My finger was broken.*
