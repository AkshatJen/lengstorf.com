What I'm using for work and entertainment, updated after 9 months on the road.

## Work and Entertainment

{{% columns %}}
- [15" MacBook Pro](http://amzn.to/1VRGz8G)

- [Amazon Kindle Paperwhite](http://amzn.to/1UHu7Lj)
- [Bose Mini SoundLink](http://amzn.to/1UHuc1M)

### Laptop Computer

I've used a smaller computer, and while I loved the ability to easily put an 11" laptop on an airplane tray table, I found myself missing a little bit of screen real estate.

The 15" MBP has a large enough screen that I feel alright without a second monitor[^usb-monitor] — and it still fits (mostly) on a tray table.

[^usb-monitor]:
    I originally left the U.S. with an [ASUS MB168B+ USB-powered monitor](http://amzn.to/1yX0wx5), thinking I'd need the extra screen real estate. I ended up getting rid of it because I felt too awkward setting it up in public, and I didn't like rearranging my windows every time it was plugged in or unplugged.

### Unlocked Phone

Having an unlocked phone is critical if you're moving between countries. In order to have data — y'know, maps and stuff — you'll need a SIM card from a local provider, and those will only work if your phone isn't locked to a network.

If you've never looked at unlocked phones before, the cost will shock you. Just keep in mind that when you get a locked phone from Verizon or T-Mobile, the cost of the phone is typically subsidized by locking you into a 12-month contract. That's *way* more expensive than buying the phone outright.

Plus, without a monthly phone bill, your costs will go way down. In Thailand, for example, $17 bought a SIM with 30 days of unlimited call, text, and data usage.[^compare]

[^compare]:
    Compared to $100/month or so to have data limits from Verizon and other U.S. providers, this made me pretty angry when I first realized I'd been grossly overcharged for phone services for *years* because I never thought to look into alternatives. Prepaid SIM all the way, baby.

### E-Reader

I originally set out with an iPad, thinking I'd use it for casual browsing and watching movies in addition to reading. I realized pretty quickly that I *only* used the iPad for reading, and it hurt my eyes to read on its screen at night.

Now that I've switched to the Kindle, I've noticed much less eye strain, and I haven't missed any iPad features at all.

### Bluetooth Speaker

I almost constantly have some sort of music playing. While we cook breakfast, Marisa and I listen to podcasts. Getting ready for the day, we listen to music. Working, I typically use [focus@will](https://www.focusatwill.com/fwf/?rc=7287523) to keep me focused (and time my [working blocks]({{< ref "blog/scheduling-maximum-productivity.md" >}})).

Being able to listen to music without headphones (and without shitty, tinny-sounding laptop speakers) makes all the difference. The Bose speaker is the right balance of high-quality sound and small physical size, which makes it ideal for my bag.

### Headphones

I have two sets of headphones because I think there's a huge difference between reasons to use headphones.

For calls and video meetings, I like to wear the Apple headphones. The built-in mic is handy, and I like that they're not noise-canceling — when I try to talk while wearing noise-canceling headphones, I feel like I [forget how to use an inside voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-jRJJqrMZQ).

But when I'm in a [focused work-block]({{< ref "blog/scheduling-maximum-productivity.md" >}}), I want to completely shut the world out and get things done. The JBL headphones are great for this.

### Cables

An HDMI cable was a late addition, but I realized that most of the places we rent have TVs with HDMI inputs — this means when I want to watch Netflix, I don't have to watch on my laptop screen.

The 3.5mm[^metric] cable doesn't see a lot of action, but when I rent a car I like to use the auxiliary input to play music from my phone through the car stereo.

[^metric]:
    1/8"-to-1/8" for the non-metric amongst us.

### Microphone

I record [a podcast](http://www.2FTAT.com), and a high-quality microphone is a crucial component for making the end result sound less-than-terrible.

If you're not doing any recording, you probably won't need this.

## Staying Plugged in Around the World

### Power Converters

It's important to have a way to plug your electronics in when you arrive in a new country. Since there are multiple standards for outlet designs, voltages, and other *electrifying*[^cdj] inconsistencies in international power delivery, it's necessary to bring an adapter.

[^cdj]:
    Look! Up in the sky! It's a groan. It's a pun. It's... **_Captain Dadjoke!_**

Not all adapters are created equal, though: some will convert voltage, and others won't. Voltages will vary from country to country between 100–240V (usually). They also vary in frequency, delivering 50 or 60Hz.

Now, you *can* check each device for its ratings[^power-brick] and make sure it can handle the current country's electrical setup. Or — if you're lazy like me — you can just get a tiny box to keep you from having to think about it.

[^power-brick]:
    Most electronics that have a power brick (like Apple's stuff — it's that white box where the cord attaches) will convert voltage on their own. But it's a good idea to just be prepared instead of having to check each item for what voltages it can handle.

(Since I put together my travel kit, I found [this power converter](http://amzn.to/1KcNy3y), which would eliminate the need for an additional surge protector. I haven't tried it myself, but the reviews are solid.)

### Surge Protector

Because I don't own many electronics, I like to keep everything plugged into a central location. So I use my power converter to make an outlet usable, then plug in my surge protector to give me 3 outlets plus a USB charging port.

This setup does two things:

1. It keeps all our stuff consolidated to one area, which makes it harder to lose things.
2. It prevents us from sitting for hours and hours on our phones or computers, because we can't keep them plugged in while we use them.

Both Marisa and I use the same three outlets, so we're mindful of how much time we're spending on our electronics.
