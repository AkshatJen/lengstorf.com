Here's a quote from a recent message I received:[^alex]

    This message came from Alex Mullan, who's [given me article ideas before]({{< ref "first-year-of-business.md" >}}).

For those counting along at home, that's nine distinct tasks — plus a workout — all accomplished in the same day.

_That's a lot of things._

Yet there's still a (totally undeserved) feeling of underachievement there. And this isn't an uncommon feeling —

**Why 

There are three major culprits in our daily working lives that contribute to burnout and/or feeling like we aren't doing enough:

1. **Wasted time.** If we feel like our time wasn't well-spent, it causes a lot of stress and unhappiness about our days.
2. **Lack of a plan.** More often than not, when we feel frazzled it's because we don't actually know what we wanted to accomplish in the first place.
3. **No urgency.** Work expands to fill the time we allow for it. If our daily schedule is, "Wake up. Work. Sleep," we'll fill our time with work, even if we don't need to.

By addressing these three areas, **we can make sure we get a lot done while we're working, _and_ make sure we have time and energy left after the work is done.** And _that_ is where the Goldilocks Zone lies.

## Cut out the biggest time wasters in your day.

One of the biggest causes of burnout is wasted time. There's nothing more frazzling than realizing it's 6pm and you've barely accomplished anything yet.

Wasted time sneaks in from a lot of places: interruptions from coworkers; "research" in the form of reading articles; social media scans; the [myriad cries for attention from our tiny robots]({{< ref "blog/fomo.md" >}}).

Many of the ways we waste time are unconscious, and the simple act of realizing they're happening will cause us to correct them.[^unconscious]

    You know how you sometimes sit down to do something, go to open the document, then black out for 45 minutes before waking up ten pages deep in [/r/dadjokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes)? That kind of stuff.

    Can’t waste time if you can’t load the damn site.

For the more conscious ways — our active efforts to waste time — a little more self control is required. If you need to outsource it, tools like [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/967986) and [Freedom](http://bit.ly/2apFsOZ) can block access to sites that derail you for a specified period of time.

## Make a plan: define what progress means to you.

**If you don't know what you set out to accomplish, it's hard to know whether you hit your goal or not.** It can feel like you "worked" all day, but didn't really do anything meaningful.

Without the clarity of purpose that comes with knowing what you're supposed to be doing, it's pretty easy to feel like the day was wasted.

## Create urgency to combat procrastination.
