[Malamén](https://www.facebook.com/malamenbarcelona) opened a few days before we wandered through its signless front door. 

Most of my affection for Barcelona stems from dumb luck: around the corner from where we stayed, a bar called [Malamén](https://www.facebook.com/malamenbarcelona) had just opened. We wandered in before they had their sign up, and the owner, Humberto, proved to be _exactly_ the kind of person you want to meet in every city.

Humberto is one of those people who is friendly, helpful, and fucking _connected_. He's the kind of guy who knows everyone that walks into his restaurant by name; who's lived everywhere; who speaks Spanish, Catalan, English, and Italian fluently. The kind of guy who, when his restaurant pushes the top of the Trip Advisor list and stays too packed for drop-in dinners, will walk you around the corner to another restaurant, introduce you to the owner, tell you what's best to order, and buy you a drink. And then come back to check on you an hour later.

When I met Humberto, Marisa and I were still getting our bearings in Barcelona's sleepy Poble Sec neighborhood. We were scared our decision to stay here had been a mistake, because everything was shuttered and uninviting. Later, we'd learn that you don't go out before noon in Barcelona because nothing is open.

At the bar, we used my [standard drinking strategy]({{< ref "blog/how-to-drink.md" >}}) and bellied up. Humberto's boyfriend, Daniel, greeted us in Catalan, and we responded in our best bad Spanish. He smiled apologetically, disappeared around a corner, and returned with Humberto in tow.

"Hello, guys! Welcome!"

Marisa and I were less than two weeks into our adventures abroad, and this was one of the first non-tourists we'd met that we could speak to without charades. I saw tension release from Marisa's shoulders. I felt my night becoming instantly better: here was a local to pepper with questions!

***

That first night in Malamén, Humberto wrote out a double-sided Barcelona todo list. He introduced us to David, Malamén's Swedish chef, who used us as a tasting panel for his new menu items throughout our stay.

In two hours, Malamén became our neighborhood bar, and Humberto treated us like old friends. When it was slow, he'd sit at the bar with us and pour us all _vermut_ and trade stories.

"I don't know how to make cocktails. I'm only okay as a cook. So my friends ask me, 'Humberto, why start a bar?' And I tell them, 'I want to have a place to bring all my friends, and my kitchen is too small.'"

I realized that there was a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of Angostura bitters[^bitters] behind the bar, and I asked for an Old Fashioned. Humberto handed me the bottle and said, "You have to show me how."

[^bitters]:
    Bitters are one of those things that no one thinks about unless they spend time around cocktail nerds. They sit on a shelf in the bar, stuffed behind unused Tom Collins glasses and forgotten because who the fuck uses bitters in a normal bar? and when you ask if they have any, the bartender will look at you like you've just made something up, think about it, and then start mumbling things like, "I _thought_ we had that at some point," as he rummages through the forgotten corners of the bar's storage.

Humberto took notes, and now has a handwritten recipe for the Old Fashioned and a Manhattan, made just the way I like them, folded up next to the cash register. The next time I came in, he made me watch — "but don't help!" — while he made us drinks.

David came out from the back one evening while I was extolling the virtues of adding bitters to everything and mentioned he could get us a reservation at a really good bar. A secret bar, he called it. His friend worked there, and could get us on the list.

He made a call, spoke his Swedish-flavored Spanish too quickly for me to catch any of it except the name he used: _Señor Potato_.

Everyone I've ever met from a Nordic country has the same, bone-dry sense of humor. I can't say I blame them; when it's that fucking cold most of the time, you can't waste warmth on jokes. On realizing that we had an off-book reservation at an unlisted bar under the name "Mr. Potato", the suspicion that this was all an elaborate prank started to creep in.

He gave us the name of the bar — Mutis — and said to head into Bar Mut first. I stepped inside, got the host's attention, and made the statement a shaky question: "_¿Tenemos una reserva para_ Mr. Potato_?_"

The pause after I finished that sentence expanded into eternity. I felt a cold panic as I realized, _oh fuck, David was pranking me, and I just asked for a fictional reservation in a fictional bar._

The host led us back outside and down the street. We rounded the corner and entered the common area of an apartment building. The host motioned us inside and disappeared.

A middle-aged man sat on a folding chair at a small table, watching movies on his laptop. He looked up as we approached, but stayed silent. Our eyes met.

I flinched first.

"_¿Tenemos una reserva para_ Mr. Potato_?_" I tensed up, ready to outrun my humiliation if this guy started laughing at me.

Instead, he pulled out a walkie talkie and asked if there was room for a Mr. Potato. The garbled response came back, and he motioned us up the stairs. First door on the left.

As we approach the first landing, the apartment door opens and a hostess gestures us inside. As we sit down, I notice a framed award on the wall: Best Bar in Europe, 2012.

## TODO Make the rest of this story a story.

This bar was packed with all the pomp and circumstance you'd expect in a speakeasy, and the cocktails managed to back up the swagger.

Another reason to meet as many locals as possible and try to make friends everywhere you go: you never know who'll send you up a dark stairway into one of the best bars in the world.

## TODO After hours/hangover story

***

The day we left, Humberto went out of his way drive us to the airport, and to send me off with a bottle of Angostura bitters.

My attraction to Barcelona is a living testament to that saying about _who_ you know; because we met Humberto, we had an amazing time in Barcelona. If we hadn't met him, we probably would have still liked the city, but I'd wager we would have seen 50% less of it.

Also, the food at Malamén is really delicious. You should eat there.

    Pakta in Barcelona, Spain.

**[Pakta](http://en.pakta.es/)** — This was a higher-end meal, so it was one of the more expensive meals I ate in 2015. However, it was also one of the most all-around excellent. We opted for the larger tasting menu, which was nine courses or so. The staff was stellar, the food was stellar, and the overall experience was one of the more memorable dining experiences I've ever had.

Pakta is one of the [Adrià brothers' suite of restaurants](http://www.elbarriadria.com/en) in Barcelona. We made it to most of them, and weren't disappointed on any occasion. The grilled octopus at [Tickets](http://www.ticketsbar.es/en) and pretty much everything on the menu at [El Niño Viejo](http://www.ninoviejo.es/en) are worth trying if you get the chance.
