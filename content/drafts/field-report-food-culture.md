## The Best Things I Ate and Drank in 2015

### Barcelona, Spain

Mutis

### London, England

Marisa has two serious addictions: burgers, and burritos. Outside the United States, both are pretty hard to find. At least, finding _good_ burgers and burritos is a challenge.

    World's Best Burger, according to Marisa.

London was a bust for good burritos, but it has a lot to offer on the burger front. The most memorable offering — indeed, what Marisa still calls "the best burger in the world" — was at [Bukowski](http://bukowski-grill.co.uk/) in Shoreditch's trendy-as-fuck [BOXPARK](http://www.boxpark.co.uk/).

The name of the grill was particularly appealing to me, partially due to my appreciation of Bukowski's writing, but more because of a quote of his that applies so perfectly to food:

> Find what you love and let it kill you.
> 
> **Charles Bukowski**

Should I die at the hands of a Bukowski burger, I can't say I'd be pissed.

A surprise that's probably not surprising to anyone but me is the prevalence of outstanding Indian food in London. It was everywhere, and it was fantastic.

[Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com/) won me over with the black daal, which I'd never heard of before I sat down in the restaurant. Everything was the right kind of spicy, the right explosion of nonsensical-sounding flavor combinations, the right balance between comfort food and a pile of veggies.

I was also happy to find that London is a city that gives a shit about good cocktails, and I tucked into a well-made classic beverage at [High Water](http://highwaterlondon.com/), where I enjoyed a great conversation with the bartender and a few locals. Later, at [Callooh Callay](http://www.calloohcallaybar.com/welcome/), I had an _oh_-so-hipster evening ordering designer cocktails off a menu shaped like a cassette tape insert (in a cassette case) with names like "Tall and Oates" and "Harrison Fords".

***

Honestly, I didn't love London. It was cold, rainy, expensive, and didn't really offer anything that I haven't seen in every other major city I've been in. Unless you're really into old architecture, you can probably find just about everything London has to offer in Portland, Oregon, for about sixty percent of the price.

I'd be happy to go back for a weekend or a conference, but I don't know that I'll plan to go there again otherwise.

### Rome, Italy

My first impression of Rome was what I expected: _this place is unbelievably beautiful._

    A few photos I snapped around Rome.

The architecture, the culture, the palpable history surrounding you on a walk through the _centro storico_ is staggering. It felt like the famous buildings and monuments I could remember from high school were all in Rome, within a forty-five minute walk of each other.

And the _food_ — god_DAMN_.

In a cooking class, we learned that _carbonara_ was "poor people food" back in the day, before it became one of Rome's most famous offerings. At [La Carbonara](http://www.lacarbonara.it/), we learned why it's famous.

We also went nuts on gelato, with our favorite spot being [Verde Pistacchio](http://www.verdepistacchiolab.it/shop/index.html).

***

After the food hangover, and after we'd walked past the Colosseum every day for three weeks on the way to the gym, the romance of Rome started to fade, and something else crept in: Rome is a very one-dimensional city.

The food is amazing, but it's all the _same_ food. By the end of our trip, I was ready to kill someone for a vegetable that wasn't fucking chicory. We went in search of variety, but all the non-Roman restaurants were just okay.

The architecture is amazing, but there are only so many photos of the Pantheon I can take before it starts to feel passé.

My takeaway from all this is that Rome is a great place to visit – for about a week. Any longer, and you'll want to be _really_ sure that you like _cacio e pepe_.

### Naples/Napoli, Italy

I never know what the "proper" way to refer to a city that has a different name in American English than what the people who live there call it. Am I a pompous douchebag if I refer to "Napoli" or "Roma"? Or am I a callous American tourist asshat if I call it "Naples" or "Rome"?

Who knows? I'm probably both. Sorry, world.

Anyways. Pizza is one of those foods that I love on many levels. Beyond the deeply satisfying combination of greasy cheese and bread with light and tangy tomato sauce, I also feel various waves of nostalgia when I eat pizza: there's the nostalgia for my childhood, when I was _so happy_ when pizza day came around in the cafeteria or at home, and I'd get my cardboard-flavored square pizza from the lunchlady, or my cardboard-flavored Red Baron pizza from my mom; there's the nostalgia for my teenage years, when I worked in at least four different pizza restaurants to support my "career" as a musician; and then there's the nostalgia for my days in Portland, where I would use my extensive background in making pizza to put together a dinner for friends where I'd make pizzas from scratch.

I'm saying all this to qualify the following statement:

_Napoli is my Mecca._

So naturally, I dragged Marisa — who "nothings" pizza[^relationship-test] — to two of the best pizzerias in the best pizza city in the world.

[^relationship-test]:
    The first true test of our relationship was when Marisa told me she didn't really like pizza. "I don't like it or dislike it. I nothing it."<br><br>I'm not saying I'm shallow enough to straight-up leave someone if they don't share my passion for the foods I love, but ... I'm _almost_ that shallow.

At [L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele](http://damichele.net/index.php?lang=uk), we sat down and ate the same pizza Julia Roberts ate in that movie I didn't watch. On the wall, there's an excerpt from the book I didn't read describing the pizza.

  "Take the picture faster. I'm about to go H.A.M. on this pizza."
{{% /caption %}}

I'm not familiar with the plot, but if _Eat Pray Love_ is about tasting that pizza, seeing god, and falling in love with melted mozzarella, then I can identify.

The other place we went, though, Dal Presidente, was awful. The waiter was a fast-talking greaseball trying to order shit we didn't want on our behalf, who then tried to give himself an enormous tip by not returning some of our change. I don't remember what the food tasted like because that guy made me so unhappy to be in the restaurant.

Aside from the pizza, Napoli is kind of gross and dirty. I would plan to drive _through_ the city to stop for lunch, but I don't know that I'd stay there.

### Istanbul, Turkey

We only stayed a few days in Istanbul, but it was enough to leave an impression.

First, there's the coffee. It's hard to drink — more because the bottom third of the cup is full of grounds than because of the flavor. _Türk kahvesi_ is everything I love about coffee: it's an ordeal that you have to commit to. There's no way to grab a Turkish coffee at a drive-through, or to slam one down in a hurry on your way to something else.

It's slow, deliberate, and intentional. You have to _be there_ for it. And at [Mandabatmaz](http://www.mandabatmaz.com.tr/), we spent a solid hour enjoying each other's company over a tiny cup of coffee.

***

Before _kahvesi_, there's _kahvaltı_. Literally: it means "before coffee".

This is one of my favorite breakfasts I've found in my travels. The idea, as far as I can tell, is to create a vast selection of delicious items in a kinda-sorta _tapas_-style arrangement. The fare is right up my alley: cheeses and meat on the heavy side, olives and tomatoes on the lighter side, with _kaymak_ (sort of like clotted cream) and fruit on the sweet side.

At [Van Kahvaltı Evi](http://www.yelp.com/biz/van-kahvalt%C4%B1-evi-istanbul-2), we found one of the more appetizing spreads.

Istanbul is loud, crowded, and more than a little hectic. Shop owners will yell at you to come inside from down the block, calling you things like "Mr. America" and "my friend". You have to haggle over everything. There are stray cats _everywhere_. But its food, depth of culture, and incredible architecture make Istanbul well worth the trip. This is a city I plan to visit again, for at least a month.
