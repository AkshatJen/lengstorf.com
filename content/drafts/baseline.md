The first time I left the United States, I was so excited I could have hung my carry-on off the front of my pants.[^lowbrow]

[^lowbrow]:
    "Jesus, he's not even going to warm us up before waving a boner joke in our faces?"

This was a trip I'd been talking about since high school — it was supposed to be _the_ big trip I took after graduation — and after nearly a decade of "saving up",[^nope] delays, and excuses, I _finally_ had my ticket.

[^nope]:
    Just kidding. I didn't save _anything_ in those days. I made an extreme sport out of trying to stretch the $8.71 in my wallet across three days until I (hopefully) got an invoice paid.

My mood improved steadily as the trip grew closer, dipping slightly a week out when the "why am I not leaving _neeaaooooowwwww_" fit of whinery kicked in, spiking up drastically when my feet touched non-American soil for the first time.

    We wandered into the Belgian countryside to try “The Best Beer in the World” at the Westvleteren Brewery at St. Sixtus Abbey.

I was able to keep the good times rolling until a few days after coming home, feeding on the envy of my family and friends as I flipped through photos and told stories.

But then came the drop. And it was no small thing; this was the precipitous, nuts-jump-to-the-stomach-and-stomach-jumps-to-the-throat variety of emotional free-fall.

I sank low. For _years_ I'd been looking forward to this trip.

But now? _It was all over._

I had nothing to look forward to. I started to worry I may never feel that kind of happiness again.

TKTK(transition: I started planning the next thing, because I needed something to look forward to.)

## Finding Happiness the Hard Way

It's tempting to measure only by extremes.

Happiness, especially, tends to be noticed only at its heights, or in its utter absence.

A "happy person" is a walking highlight reel: a dream wedding with a romantic destination honeymoon chaser; a new puppy to round out graduation and the start of a promising career; a bucket list vacation photo series with a first-class-upgrade cherry on top.

Our high points are often the only metric used to determine how happy we are. And thanks to the latent one-upsmanship we all tend to suffer from, in order to "stay happy" we need to reach for higher and higher highs.[^boring]

[^boring]:
    There's actually some psychological headfuckery at work here: as we have experiences, doing the same thing starts to feel boring — no matter how exciting it may have been at first. I've talked about how we can use this as a [tool to overcome fear]({{< ref "2015-09-24_overcoming-fear.md" >}}), but in the case of happiness it can work against us.

More exotic vacations.[^exotic] Bigger adventures. Go further, go harder, do more, _or else you'll be sad_.

[^exotic]:
    Oh, you stayed in a quaint little _cabina_ in Costa Rica? Well, _we_ stayed in a Moroccan _riad_. Yeah? _We_ stayed in a cave house in Cappadocia. Oh yeah? _We stayed in a fucking tree house in Peru._ SUCK IT WE STAYED IN A CASTLE.

### If we only chase higher highs, we're opening ourselves up for lower lows.

The catch with focusing only on the ups, though, is that it ignores a fundamental truth: life happens in swings.

So if the highs are getting increasingly higher, we stand to experience even lower lows.[^newton]

[^newton]:
    Thanks for nothing, Newtonian mechanics.

My big trip, for example, was the highest high I'd reached at that point in my life. So on the downswing — when the trip was over, and all my anticipation, planning, and experiencing were behind me — I was crushed.

## Here's a Simpler Example: Say You've Got a Cupcake

Now, this cupcake looks _amazing_. It's still a bit warm from the oven. It's the perfect mix of moist and springy. The icing is buttercream, made from scratch. _It's filled with goddamn salted caramel._

{{< caption src="/images/cupcake.jpg"

    My love, there’s only you in my life...
{{< /caption >}}

As you look at it on your plate, you think about how great it will taste. Your Pavlovian cupcake response kicks in and you drool and lick your lips and your palms sweat and you close all the curtains so you can be alone for this.[^normal]

[^normal]:
    This is how everyone eats cupcakes, right?

And then — oh god — you take a bite. _Holy dammit Christmas_ this is a good cupcake. The world fades away, and it's just you and this cupcake and ["Endless Love"](https://youtu.be/qnfwnOp6uek) playing in the background.

{{< youtube qnfwnOp6uek >}}

But then, just as quickly as it started, it's all over. Even as you desperately lick your fingers, you know it's true: the cupcake is gone.

Where once you soared on the sugary wings of eagles, you now wallow in the bitter depths of sadness. Never again will you have this cupcake. Never again will this heavenly confection pass your lips.

The plate is empty. You are utterly alone in the world.

Minutes pass, feeling like years. The world is cold and flavorless. All colors have gone grey in this, the world without cupcakes.

But no. This is not the end. You're strong. You've lived without cupcakes before, and goddammit you can live without them now.

You don't know how, but life will continue, step after merciless, unsprinkled step, until somehow, someday, hope can return.

## How to Create Long-Term Happiness: Focus on the Baseline

For most of my teens and twenties, [I chased happiness as a sort of destination]({{< ref "finding-happiness.md" >}}). I'd see something shiny, struggle toward it, achieve it, feel amazing for the briefest of moments, and then plunge into the existential quagmire of existing without goals — until I saw something shiny.

It was a strange sort of holding pattern, where I'd oscillate between euphoria and angst, always at about the same frequency. My overall _average happiness_, if we look at the highs and lows on a graph, stayed about the same.

  The highs and the lows average out, and overall nothing changes.

**I was pretty happy sometimes, and pretty sad sometimes, and mostly nothing changed.**

### Don't live in a world where the best cupcakes are behind you.

Since we generally acclimate to circumstances pretty quickly, staying the same often feels like things are getting worse.

And _that_ is where things can become bad, because when we make predictions about how we're going to feel, they tend to be self-fulfilling prophecies.

{{< caption src="/images/cupcake-longing-for-the-past-w-baseline.jpg"
            align="center"
            alt="all the best cupcakes are behind me" >}}
  If we believe all the best cupcakes are behind us, we may not be open to trying new cupcakes.
{{< /caption >}}

**If I believe that things are in decline, and all the good stuff happened in the past, it's a short jump to resigning myself to a life where the best years are behind me.**

This is where bitterness comes from, and the suspicion that there's only so much happiness (or love, or money, or whatever) in the world, and that someone else is getting your share.

And if we look at happiness as a zero-sum game, we're all fucked.

## How to Have Higher Highs (Without the Crash)
### 1. Only keep score against yourself.
### 2. Learn the difference between fault and responsibility.
### 3. Measure by all of what matters: outcome, growth, and experience.

## What's the point?

We all have swings in our moods. Some days we're up, and other days we're way down. Our instinct is often to seek out higher highs — bigger adventures, loftier titles, newer toys — but that opens us up to even lower lows on the downswing (thanks for nothing, Newtonian mechanics). But we're not totally fucked here; if we aim to raise the baseline, several things happen:

1. Our highs are higher.
2. Our lows aren't nearly as low.
3. Our day-to-day average moods are higher overall.

We can raise our baseline surprisingly quickly with a few mental exercises:

1. Only keep score against yourself.
2. Focus only on what you can control, and accept responsibility.
3. Measure by growth and experience in addition to outcomes.
