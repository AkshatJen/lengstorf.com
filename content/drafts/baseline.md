The first time I left the United States, I was so excited I could have hung my carry-on off the front of my pants.[^lowbrow]

[^lowbrow]:
    "Jesus, he's not even going to warm us up before waving a boner joke in our faces?"

This was a trip I'd been talking about since high school — it was supposed to be _the_ big trip I took after graduation — and after nearly a decade of excuses, I _finally_ had my ticket.

My mood improved steadily as the trip grew closer, dipping slightly a week out when the "why am I not leaving _neeaaooooowwwww_" fit of whinery kicked in, spiking up drastically when my feet touched non-American soil for the first time.

    We wandered into the Belgian countryside to try “The Best Beer in the World” at the Westvleteren Brewery at St. Sixtus Abbey.

My euphoria was sustained through the whole trip,[^jet-lag] except for the last couple days when I ran out of money and had to make hard choices between food and train fare.

[^jet-lag]:
    I'm counting the 36 hours I was unconscious due to a deep misunderstanding of jet lag and my diligent effort to "just power through it, bro".

I was able to keep the good times rolling for a couple days after coming home, feeding my high the envy of my family and friends as I flipped through photos and told stories.

But then came the drop. And it was no small thing; this was the precipitous, nuts-jump-to-the-stomach-and-stomach-jumps-to-the-throat variety of free-fall.

I sank low. For _years_ I'd been looking forward to this trip. At first it was just a vague kind of someday plan; then it was a real possibility, and then the ticket was booked, and I reveled in the planning and imagining and preparation.

But now? _It was all over._

Suddenly I had nothing to look forward to. And I started to worry I may never feel that kind of happiness again.

TKTK(transition: I started planning the next thing, because I needed something to look forward to.)

## Finding Happiness the Hard Way

It's extremely tempting to measure only by the extremes.

Happiness is especially inclined to be measured in extremes. A "happy person" is a walking highlight reel: a dream wedding with a romantic destination honeymoon chaser; a new puppy to round out graduation and the start of a promising career; a bucket list vacation photo series with a first-class upgrade cherry on top.

Our high points come to define our happiness. And, thanks to the inherent dickheadedness of our expectations, in order to "stay happy" we need to reach constantly higher and higher points.[^boring]

[^boring]:
    There's actually some psychological headfuckery at work here: as we have experiences, doing the same thing starts to feel boring — no matter how exciting it may have been at first. I've talked about how we can use this as a [tool to overcome fear]({{< ref "2015-09-24_overcoming-fear.md" >}}), but in the case of happiness it can work against us.

More exotic vacations. Bigger adventures. Go further, go harder, do more, _or else you'll be sad_.

### If we only chase higher highs, we're opening ourselves up for lower lows.

The catch with focusing only on the upswings, though, is that it ignores a fundamental truth: life happens in swings.

So if the highs are getting increasingly higher, we stand to experience even lower lows.[^newton]

[^newton]:
    Thanks for nothing, Newtonian mechanics.

My big trip, for example, was the highest high I'd reached at that point in my life. So on the downswing — when the trip was over, and all my anticipation, planning, and experiencing were behind me — I was crushed.

### Here's a simpler example: say you've got a cupcake.

Now, this cupcake looks _amazing_. It's still a bit warm from the oven. It's the perfect mix of moist and springy. The icing is buttercream, made from scratch. _It's filled with goddamn salted caramel._

    My love, there’s only you in my life...

As you look at it on your plate, you think about how great it will taste. Your Pavlovian cupcake response kicks in and you drool and lick your lips and your palms sweat and you close all the curtains so you can be alone for this.[^normal]

[^normal]:
    This is how everyone eats cupcakes, right?

And then — oh god — you take a bite. _Holy dammit Christmas_ this is a good cupcake. The world fades away, and it's just you and this cupcake and ["Endless Love"](https://youtu.be/qnfwnOp6uek) playing in the background.

{{< youtube qnfwnOp6uek >}}

But then, just as quickly as it started, it's all over. Even as you desperately lick your fingers, you know it's true: the cupcake is gone.

Where once you soared on the sugary wings of eagles, you now plummet into the depths of sadness. Never again will you have this cupcake. Never again will this heavenly apparition of a confection brush your lips.

The plate is empty. You are alone.

## What's the point?

We all have swings in our moods. Some days we're up, and other days we're way down. Our instinct is often to seek out higher highs — bigger adventures, loftier titles, newer toys — but that opens us up to even lower lows on the downswing (thanks for nothing, Newtonian mechanics). But we're not totally fucked here; if we aim to raise the baseline, several things happen:

1. Our highs are higher.
2. Our lows aren't nearly as low.
3. Our day-to-day average moods are higher overall.

We can raise our baseline surprisingly quickly with a few mental exercises:

1. Only keep score against yourself.
2. Focus only on what you can control, and accept responsibility.
3. Measure by growth and experience in addition to outcomes.
