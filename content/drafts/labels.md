When I wrote my [retrospective on a year of full-time travel]({{< ref "blog/2015-12-30_year-in-review.md" >}}), I included a section about my distaste for the label "digital nomad":

Since writing that, the idea of labels has been rolling around in my head.

## Why I Get Squeamish About Labels

My entire adult life, I've tried to avoid being labeled. But until recently I'd never asked myself _why_ I was uncomfortable with labels.

Why is it that, when I started a company, I wouldn't call it a "startup"?

When I talk about what I do, why do I shy away from terms like "founder" or "entrepreneur"?

What's my aversion to becoming "a CrossFitter" or a "digital nomad"?

Of course, the _obvious_ reason is that I'm such a goddamned special little snowflake that I can't be labeled. But debilitating narcissism aside, I just don't feel comfortable waving the banners of a group.

## \#1: Adopting a Label Means Adopting a Set of Rules

Becoming a digital nomad, if you read the articles about it online, would imply that you need to meet certain criteria in order to officially belong to the group.

You need to sell all your stuff and travel the world. You need to visit certain "DN hubs". You need to choose which faction you belong to: the Programmers, the Marketers and Drop-Shippers, or the Travel Bloggers.[^factions]

[^factions]:
    This in itself is a "rule" that bothers me: there is no real limit to what you can do remotely for work. If your job is based on the computer and/or conversation, [you can work from anywhere]({{< ref "remote-work-course.md" >}}).

And while none of these rules are real — mostly they're the opinions of early-adopting writers who get cited by the next wave of writers (who are then cited by the mainstream writers who've started hearing about this "hot new trend") until the ideas become canon — they all create barriers and pressure.

In the [Digital Nomad subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/), there are frequent questions about "becoming a digital nomad" asking if one itinerary or another would qualify someone as a _true_ nomad.

But to ask whether you're _truly_ a digital nomad is similar to asking if you're _truly_ a vegan: it depends who you ask, and what kind of mood they're in.[^veggies]

[^veggies]:
    For the readers not located in cities where vegans can be overheard infighting, just imagine a religious debate about whether yeast feels pain.

Trying to subscribe to a label brings with it all the stresses and anxieties of chasing "cool" — the rules of inclusion are constantly changing, sometimes contradictory, and always half-buried under a snowdrift of asterisks.[^cool]

[^cool]:
    Men can't wear capri pants; that's just _unthinkably_ uncool.\*<br><br>\* Except Andre 3000. That motherfucker can wear whatever he wants. Except some of his more questionable hats; big stupid hats are always uncool.\*\*<br><br>\*\* Unless you're Pharrell Williams. He wore the shit out of that big stupid hat.

### Following rules blindly is inherently uncool.

This is the paradox that labels present: we want to be part of these groups to become cooler, but we all look at people who join groups and follow their rules mindlessly as "sheep" or "drones" — _never_ as cool.

I learned this — much like I've learned most of my lessons — by completely ignoring that it could be true until it was far too late.

My band came on the tail end of a trendy sort of music called "emo". Emo emerged from the death throes of pop punk music, when kids got sick of songs about house parties. These were _emotional_ songs, with _feelings_ that _mattered_.[^blood] But we weren't just _emo_; we were part of a post-emo movement called screamo, which was an evolution of post-hardcore that didn't head back toward butt rock, and then are you asleep? Sorry. Moving on.

[^blood]:
    Just kidding. It was the same as pop punk, except we replaced lyrics like, "well I guess this is growing up," with, "jet black, the blood that's in your veins!"

We wanted to make it, and "making it" as an emo band meant we had to _look_ like an emo band: black hair falling in our eyes, black eyeliner, tight t-shirt, white belt, skinny jeans — it was a full-on uniform.

I'd look at the cool kids in the emo scene and figure out how I could look more like them, which — presumably — would make me more emo (and therefore more cool).

With the benefit of hindsight, I can see how absurd this all feels. At the time, however, this seemed _critically important_.

## \#2: Adopting a Label Makes You a Stereotype

Picture an Herbalife salesperson. A "legalize marijuana" activist. A yoga fanatic. A CrossFitter.

Each of those labels carries stereotypes: Herbalife salespeople are get-rich-quick suckers who get pulled into multi-level marketing schemes; legal weed proponents are unwashed hippie burnouts (or aspiring burnouts); yoga fanatics spout starchild bullshit like, "Feel the universe tingle on your skin like a thousand tiny kisses from the stars"; CrossFitters eat Paleo, work out so hard they puke, and judge the holy Christ out of you for not joining CrossFit.

Accurate or not, these are the stereotypes that haunt the people who choose to lead with their labels.

### Why would anyone voluntarily become a stereotype?

If your Tinder bio reads, "I like CrossFit and craft beer," you've effectively outsourced your entire personality to two labels' accompanying stereotypes.

Pat the Human is a blank slate. We can make some basic assumptions — Pat most likely consumes food, sleeps, and occasionally goes on a Netflix binge — but beyond that we'd have to observe Pat to make our judgments.

Pat the Anti-Vaxxer, on the other hand, is a helicopter mom trying to shake up the monotony of upper-middle-class motherhood with attempted filicide.

Pat the Startup Developer is a white dude who's ignorantly strengthening the patriarchy and only making the world better for other white dudes who prefer smartphones to people.

Pat the Digital Nomad is living in Southeast Asia, broke and socially inept, because an ebook claimed you can live there for $300/month and make a fortune selling ebooks to <del>suckers</del> <ins>people</ins> who want to become digital nomads.

In each of these cases, we didn't need to meet Pat, or see Pat's behavior, to make a sweeping judgment about the content of Pat's character. For all we know, the Pat behind all three of these labels might be the same person.[^super-pat]

[^super-pat]:
    Pat the Anti-Vaxxing Digital Nomad Developer: currently renting a Balinese hovel, selling ebooks on how to make money as a digital nomad to fund the creation of a "killer app" that helps parents find the nearest [measles party](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/09/3621020/measles-parties-california/). Some people — mostly Pat — are calling it "the Uber of intentionally infecting children with diseases".

That's the insidious thing: **rather than enhancing who we tell the world we are, labels completely overwrite us.** Labels replace our personalities — the things we do and say and stand for — with presumptions — the things our labels give us the appearance of doing and saying and standing for.

## \#3: Adopting a Label Means a Bunch of Strangers Can Fuck Up Your Reputation

Closely related to stereotypes, another problem with adopting a label is the risk of letting other members of the group — total strangers in many cases — make decisions about how the rest of the world views you.

In one of the saddest examples of how this can go wrong, imagine a Catholic priest. For over a thousand years, the life of a clergyman in the church was a respected position, largely considered a good thing.

Then, news reports come out that that some Catholic priests are child molesters and that the church covered it up.

Now, a good portion of the world looks at _all_ Catholic priests sideways, like, "I don't know about those priest types... I heard their kind are all kidfuckers."

Similarly, startup dudes everywhere are expected to be socially inept, micro-aggression-lobbing twenty- and thirty-something white males. The world sees _Silicon Valley_ and Mark Zuckerberg and that stereotype sinks in.

Sometimes these strangers are the figureheads at the epicenter of the label, like in the case of Donald Trump giving renewed life to a caricature of Republicans as bigoted, out of touch, and largely solipsistic.

Other times — in the digital nomad movement, for instance — the strangers are bandwagon jumpers who exploit an angle and taint the entire community: get-rich-quick hucksters who move to a hub city for a month before launching their "how to become a digital nomad in X" ebook, attempting to capitalize on the media's current fascination with location-independent workers.

In either case, people you don't know — people who have nothing to do with you other than affixing the same label to themselves — are now wielding influence over your reputation.

## \#4: Applying a Label Creates an "Us vs. Them"

I'm not much of a gamer,[^games] but it was hard to miss the media shitstorm surrounding [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy).

[^games]:
    The closest I get is _Two Dots_ when I have a few minutes to kill.

In the spirit of this article, I'm choosing not to research what _actually_ happened; I want to share the stereotypes that leaked out to me — the non-gamer — that are now attached to "gamers" in my brain. That, and I don't have a wifi connection right now and can't be bothered to look it up on my phone.

Here's how I understood Gamergate:

1. Concerns were raised that women have been represented in sexist ways in most video games: scantily-clad, dependent on male heroes, and so on.
2. Game studios started to include more diversity in games' heroes.
3. Male gamers did not like this, and got _real_ upset about the "oppression" this represented.
4. Females in the gaming sphere started speaking out in favor of diversity in games.
5. Angry male gamers started cyber-stalking these women, publishing sensitive personal information like home addresses, and making rape and death threats.

It's hard to imagine that many of the (who I assume to be) teenaged boys who stalked and threatened people as part of Gamergate would ever do anything like that on their own.[^clarification]

[^clarification]:
    What I mean by that is that the average video-game-playing teenaged boy is very unlikely to receive new information about video games and, with very little preamble, respond with, "I WILL RAPE AND KILL YOU."

However, because they're "gamers", the group felt threatened by change, and — galvanized by their label — they started kicking ideas around in an echo chamber. Since there wasn't much by way of dissenting opinion, the ideas were able to amplify and mutate, changing from a probably-innocuous-at-first idea ("I disagree with Felicia Day") to something horrifying ("We should kill Felicia Day").

### The most dangerous place to live is in an echo chamber.

Labels create closed communities, and those communities become breeding grounds for extremism.

Even on an ostensibly open platform like social media, people are able to create walled gardens of _only_ the people who match their labels, and as a result we see misinformation and hate somehow spreading _faster_, despite the fact that there's more access to facts than ever before.

Finding our "tribe" (_read: fellow label adherents_) online gives us the illusion of control, but really it's an Orwellian form of mob justice. The label stands in for your conscience, substituting its own ends for your moral compass.

When I was in my emo phase, I didn't respond to new situations by asking, "How do I want to respond to this?" Instead, I asked, "[What's the emo way to handle this?]({{< ref "no-one-is-coming-to-save-you.md" >}})"

In my case it was silly, but this line of reasoning becomes fucking terrifying when the labels belong to extremist groups (see also: the "God Hates Fags" sect of Christian terrorists).

## The Difference Between Doing a Thing and Letting a Thing Define You

At this point it's probably safe to say I've offended CrossFitters, conservatives, Christians, digital nomads, the startup crowd, and several other groups.

But if I've offended you (and you didn't close this tab in anger already), allow me to make an important distinction in this argument.

**There is a _huge_ difference between "doing a thing" and "letting a thing define you".**

There are people who go to a CrossFit gym. And then there are _CrossFitters_.

There are vegans. And then there are _Vegans_.

There are people who travel often and work remotely. And then there are _Digital Nomads_.

We can _do_ a thing without all the trappings of _becoming_ a thing.

**Drawing that line is critically important.**

### If we leave off the label, we can take only the good parts.

> Once you label me you negate me.
> 
> **Søren Kierkegaard**

I love to eat food; it's one of my key motivations for traveling. I choose destinations based on how appealing the cuisine sounds.

But I would _never_ call myself a "foodie".

And that's okay — I can enjoy all the benefits that being a foodie provides — I can love food, seek out great dining experiences and new flavors and dishes — and avoid all of the bullshit (I don't have to write food reviews, remember all the names of chefs, or give a fuck about using the right terminology to describe what I'm tasting). I just get to eat, enjoy it, and go home.

I've also taken pieces of tech culture, tattoo culture, music culture, travel culture, and myriad other groups — all with their own labels — that make me the person I am now. But I skip the label, and for better or worse that lets me leave behind the pressure, the rules, the bullshit, the externalization of what I stand for.

I get to do my best to define myself as _myself_, and not as a patchwork of outsourced identities.

And I don't even know if that's actually what's happening — honestly, I have no idea if other people are labeling me when they describe me.

### Other people may label us, but we should never label ourselves.

My friend Richelle showed me this fantastically simple way of choosing things to worry about: draw a circle and label the inside, "Things I Can Control". The outside is "Things I Can't Control". Then write down all the things that are bothering you and place them either inside or outside that circle.

Someone out there may call me a "digital nomad", or any number of other labels, both flattering and unflattering.

I can't help that. Everyone gets their opinion.

What I _can_ help is what I choose to believe about myself. Do I choose to believe that I'm restricted by the labels I've applied to myself? Or do I choose to make my decisions based on what will actually make me happy?

I won't always get it right, but I'm sure as shit going to try and do the things that make me happy, and fuck worrying about a label that might contradict that choice.

Maybe I'm not "supposed to" do a certain thing because of what other people assume I should do and be, but when the chips are down, I'll choose happiness over perceived appropriateness. Every. Fucking. Time.

## But Isn't "Anti-Label" a Label?

"Whoa whoa whoa," I can hear you thinking. "Isn't going 'anti-label' just another label that contrarian douchebags use to make themselves feel unique?"

And it's hard for me to argue with that, because the difference between a rebellious teenager claiming anti-label as his label, and what I'm advocating here is kind of like pornography: hard to define, but "I know it when I see it."

The key distinction is that my goal isn't to get people to describe me as "the anti-label guy". More importantly, I don't call myself that. 

People are bombarded with information on all fronts from the time they wake up until the time they fall asleep. So we take shortcuts: clichés, proverbs, aphorisms, maxims, and precepts. In many cases, these shortcuts are helpful: they provide shorthand for behavioral codes of conduct, pass down general wisdom, and compress complex ideas into a compact phrase (e.g. "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush").

But when we take these shortcuts with people, things get weird. Labels become stereotypes become prejudices, and we stop seeing someone as an individual — instead, we see her as a member of whatever group we've labeled her into (or, worse, the groups she's labeled _herself_ into). This is the sneaky little seed that grows into racism, classism, sexism, and all the other -isms: deciding that Jenny can't just be Jenny, because she's Jenny of the Women and therefore is burdened with all the preconceived roles and assumptions that we placed on the Women.[^white-guys]

[^white-guys]:
    As I've been thinking more and more about this — specifically about how labels supercede our personalities when we allow them to take over — it hit me in a real way (as opposed to the dim understanding that something is true) that these label issues that sit at the foundation of sexism, racism, et al. have never affected me, because the idea that I, Jason, could somehow be a representative of All White Men is absurd, and it sounds absurd to everyone. Yet somehow, whenever we see a woman or a black person in an interview, they're asked to answer questions on behalf of All Women or All Black People, as if it's somehow _not_ ridiculous to expect them to speak for "their kind". As if there's a cabal of All Women that meets every second Thursday to hash out what they stand for, and what major events do and don't count as "big wins for women everywhere".

The most damaging effect, though, is when we take these shortcuts with ourselves. When I cop out on defining who I want to be and just adopt a label, I've relinquished control of my own identity. Rather than being an individual with my own unique assortment of ambitions, tastes, and idiosyncracies, I've removed my own will and chosen to let the group make those decisions for me.

If [the story I tell myself]({{< ref "blog/stories.md" >}}) is that I am my labels, I've cut off huge areas of opportunity for personal development, exploration, new ideas, and growth. Not because I have an aversion to becoming better, but because I took a shortcut that prevented me from even _seeing_ that those opportunities existed in the first place.

## Are You Interested in a Label-Free Life?

This post isn't intended to be a definitive solution; it's a jumping-off point for a discussion about labels. This is what I've come up with after discussing my experience with a few of my closest friends, but my experience doesn't extend beyond me.

So I want to hear what about this post felt right, and what felt wrong. _To you._

What impact have labels played in your life? Have labels hurt you? Helped you? And were those labels applied externally? Or did you apply them to yourself?
