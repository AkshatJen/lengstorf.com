When I wrote my [retrospective on last year's travel]({{< ref "blog/2015-12-30_year-in-review.md" >}}), I included a section about my distaste for the label "digital nomad":

Since writing that, the idea of labels has been rolling around in my head.

## The Problem with Labels

My entire adult life, I've tried to avoid being labeled. But until recently I'd never asked myself _why_ I was uncomfortable with labels.

Why is it that, when I started a company, I wouldn't call it a "startup"?

When I talk about what I do, why do I shy away from terms like "founder" or "entrepreneur"?

What's my aversion to becoming "a CrossFitter" or a "digital nomad"?

### \#1: Labels come with rules

Becoming a digital nomad, if you read the articles about it online, would imply that you need to meet certain criteria in order to officially belong to the group.

You need to sell all your stuff and travel the world. You need to put certain "DN Hubs" on your route. You need to choose which faction you belong to: the Web Folks, the Drop-Shippers, or the Writers.[^factions]

[^factions]:
    This in itself is a rule that bothers me: there is no real limit to what you can do remotely for work. If your job is based on the computer and/or conversation, you can do it from anywhere.

And while none of these rules are real — mostly they're the opinions of early-adopting writers who get cited by newcomers until the ideas become canon — they all create barriers and pressure.

If you watch the [Digtal Nomad subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/), there are typically multiple posts daily where someone wants to "get in on this whole DN thing." The posts usually feature questions about whether or not they'd _truly_ be digital nomads.

But to ask whether you're _truly_ a digital nomad is similar to asking if you're _truly_ a vegan: it depends who you ask.[^veggies]

[^veggies]:
    For the readers not located in cities where vegans can be overheard infighting, just imagine a religious debate about whether yeast feels pain.

Trying to subscribe to a label brings with it all the stresses and anxieties of chasing "cool" — the rules of inclusion are constantly changing, sometimes contradictory, and always half-buried under a snowdrift of asterisks.[^cool]

[^cool]:
    Men can't wear capri pants; that's just _unthinkably_ uncool.\*<br><br>\* Except Andre 3000. That motherfucker can wear whatever he wants. Except some of his more questionable hats; big stupid hats are always uncool.\*\*<br><br>\*\* Unless you're Pharrell Williams. He wore the shit out of that big stupid hat.

### \#2: Labels come with stereotypes

Picture an Herbalife salesperson. A "legalize marijuana" activist. A yoga fanatic. A CrossFitter.

Each of those labels carries stereotypes: Herbalife salespeople are get-rich-quick suckers who get pulled into multi-level marketing schemes; legal weed proponents are unwashed hippie burnouts (or aspiring burnouts); yoga fanatics spout starchild bullshit like, "Feel the universe engulf you like a warm ocean of love, and let positivity tingle on your skin like a thousand tiny kisses"; CrossFitters eat Paleo, work out so hard they puke, and judge the holy Christ out of you for not going to CrossFit.

Accurate or not, these are the stereotypes that haunt the people who choose to lead with their labels.

If your Tinder bio reads, "I like CrossFit and craft beer," you've effectively outsourced your entire personality to two labels' accompanying stereotypes.

Pat the Human is a blank slate. We can make some basic assumptions — Pat most likely consumes food, sleeps, and occasionally goes on a Netflix binge — but beyond that we'd have to observe Pat to make our judgments.

Pat the Anti-Vaxxer, on the other hand, is a helicopter mom trying to shake up the monotony of upper-middle-class motherhood with attempted filicide.

Pat the Startup Developer is a white dude who's ignorantly strengthening the patriarchy and only making the world better for other white dudes who prefer smartphones to people.

Pat the Digital Nomad is living in Southeast Asia, broke and socially inept, because an ebook claimed you can live there for $300/month and make a fortune selling ebooks to <del>suckers</del> <ins>people</ins> who want to become digital nomads.

In each of these cases, we didn't need to meet Pat, or see Pat's behavior, to make a sweeping judgment about the content of Pat's character. For all we know, the Pat behind all three of these labels might be the same person.[^super-pat]

[^super-pat]:
    Pat the Anti-Vaxxing Digital Nomad Developer: currently renting a Balinese hovel, selling ebooks on how to make money as a digital nomad to fund the creation of a "killer app" that helps parents find the nearest [measles party](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/09/3621020/measles-parties-california/). Some people — mostly Pat — are calling it "the Uber of intentionally infecting children with diseases".

That's the insidious thing: **rather than enhancing who we tell the world we are, labels completely overwrite us.** Labels replace our personalities — the things we do and say and stand for — with presumptions — the things our labels give us the appearance of doing and saying and standing for.

### \#3: Labels come with a bunch of strangers who can fuck up your reputation

Closely related to stereotypes, another problem with adopting a label is the risk of letting other members of the group — total strangers in many cases — make decisions about how the rest of the world views you.

In one of the saddest examples of how this can go wrong, imagine a Catholic priest. For over a thousand years, the life of a clergyman in the church was a respected position, largely considered a good thing.

Then, news reports come out that that some Catholic priests are child molesters and that the church covered it up.

Now, a good portion of the world looks at _all_ Catholic priests with suspicion, like, "I don't know about priests... I heard his kind are all kidfuckers."

Similarly, startup dudes everywhere are expected to be socially struggling, hoodie rocking, micro-aggression lobbing twenty- and thirty-something white males. The world sees _Silicon Valley_ and Mark Zuckerberg and that stereotype sinks in.

Sometimes these strangers are the figureheads at the epicenter of the label, like in the case of Donald Trump giving renewed life to a caricature of Republicans as bigoted, out of touch, and stupid.

Other times — in the digital nomad movement, for instance — the strangers are bandwagon jumpers who exploit an angle and taint the entire community: get-rich-quick hucksters who move to a hub city for a month before launching their "how to become a digital nomad in X" ebook, attempting to capitalize on the media's current fascination with location-independent workers.

In either case, people you don't know — people who have nothing to do with you other than affixing the same label to themselves — are now wielding influence over your reputation.

### \#4: Labels encourage groupthink

I'm not much of a gamer,[^games] but it was hard to miss the media shitstorm surrounding [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy).

[^games]:
    The closest I get is Angry Birds when I have a few minutes to kill.

In the spirit of this article, I'm choosing not to research what _actually_ happened; I want to share the stereotypes that leaked out to me — the non-gamer — that are now attached to gamers. That, and I don't have a wifi connection right now and can't be bothered to look it up on my phone.

Here's how I understood Gamergate:

1. There was a concern raised that women were represented in sexist ways in most video games: scantily-clad, dependent on male heroes, etc.
2. Game studios started to include more diversity in games' heroes.
3. Male gamers did not like this, and got _real_ upset about the "oppression" they faced.
4. Females in the gaming sphere started speaking out in favor of diversity in games.
5. Angry male gamers started cyber-stalking these women, publishing sensitive personal information like home addresses, and making rape and death threats.

It's hard to imagine that many of the (who I assume to be) teenaged boys who stalked and threatened people as part of Gamergate would ever do anything like that on their own.

However, because they're "gamers", the group felt threatened by change, and — galvanized by their label — they started kicking ideas around in an echo chamber. Since there wasn't much by way of dissenting opinion, the ideas were able to amplify and mutate, changing from a probably-innocuous initial idea ("I disagree with Felicia Day") to something horrifying ("We should kill Felicia Day").

Labels create closed communities, and those communities become breeding grounds for extremism.

Even on an inherently open platform like social media, people are able to create walled gardens of just the people who match their labels, and as a result we see misinformation and hate somehow spreading _faster_, despite the fact that there's more access to facts than ever before.

Finding our "tribe" (_read: fellow label adherents_) online gives us the illusion of control, but really it's an Orwellian form of mob justice. The label stands in for your conscience, substituting its own ends for your moral compass.

It's the external comfort of the label that allows us to overcome the cognitive dissonance of doing something awful:

"I would _never_ remove my neighbor from his home and drop him in a labor camp. But I'm an _American_, and _Americans_ need to beat the threat of the Japanese ... so fuck the Tanaka family."

"I believe everyone deserves the right to be free, but Muslims [label] are threatening Americans [label], and I'm an American, so if I have to choose I choose America."

That's now how reality works, but when we dumb down reality using labels, the logic seems obvious and straightforward.

## Why I'm Working Toward a Label-Free Bio

Once I started to see the sneaky evil of slapping labels on myself, I made a decision: I would do my best to avoid lumping myself into a group in the future.

An important distinction to draw is that I don't _avoid associating with people_. I'm not advocating that no one ever joins a CrossFit gym or plays a video game. I only avoid _allowing the label to define me_, and — more importantly — allowing the group to make decisions on my behalf.

> Once you label me you negate me.

### It eliminates some of my automatic behavior


### It forces me to own every decision I make


### It prevents me from choosing friends by default


## But Isn't "Anti-Label" a Label?

"Whoa whoa whoa," I can hear you thinking. "Isn't going 'anti-label' just another label that contrarian douchebags use to make themselves feel unique?"

And it's hard for me to argue with that, because the difference between a rebellious teenager claiming anti-label as his label, and what I'm advocating here is kind of like pornography: hard to define, but "I know it when I see it."

The key distinction is that my goal isn't to get people to describe me as "the anti-label guy". More importantly, I don't call myself that. 

People are bombarded with information on all fronts from the time they wake up until the time they fall asleep. So we take shortcuts: clichés, proverbs, aphorisms, maxims, and precepts. In many cases, these shortcuts are helpful: they provide shorthand for behavioral codes of conduct, pass down general wisdom, and compress complex ideas into a compact phrase (e.g. "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush").

But when we take these shortcuts with people, things get weird. Labels become stereotypes become prejudices, and we stop seeing someone as an individual — instead, we see her as a member of whatever group we've labeled her into (or, worse, the groups she's labeled _herself_ into). This is the sneaky little seed that grows into racism, classism, sexism, and all the other -isms: deciding that Jenny can't just be Jenny, because she's Jenny of the Women and therefore is burdened with all the preconceived roles and assumptions that we placed on the Women.[^white-guys]

[^white-guys]:
    As I've been thinking more and more about this — specifically about how labels supercede our personalities when we allow them to take over — it hit me in a real way (as opposed to the dim understanding that something is true) that these label issues that sit at the foundation of sexism, racism, et al. have never affected me, because the idea that I, Jason, could somehow be a representative of All White Men is absurd, and it sounds absurd to everyone. Yet somehow, whenever we see a woman or a black guy in an interview, they're asked to answer questions on behalf of All Women or All Black People, as if it's somehow _not_ ridiculous to expect them to speak for "their kind". It feels like we've created a cultural delusion where we believe there's a cabal of All Women that meets every second Thursday to hash out what they stand for, and what major events do and don't count as "big wins for women everywhere".

The most damaging effect, though, is when we take these shortcuts with ourselves. When I cop out on defining who I want to be and just adopt a label, I've relinquished control of my own identity. Rather than being an individual with my own unique assortment of ambitions, tastes, and idiosyncracies, I've removed my own will and chosen to let the group make those decisions for me.

If [the story I tell myself]({{< ref "blog/stories.md" >}}) is that I am my labels, I've cut off huge areas of opportunity for personal development, exploration, new ideas, and growth. Not because I have an aversion to becoming better, but because I took a shortcut that prevented me from even _seeing_ that those opportunities existed in the first place.

### Anti-label means resisting external definition.

There's no way to stop people from labeling each other. We're hard-wired to stereotype for simplicity — we'd be locked in endless analysis otherwise.

What we _can_ control, however, is whether or not we internalize those labels.

For years, I was told I wasn't a "people person". And, because the evidence was in favor of that label, I internalized it. I believed that I wasn't a people person, and my social interactions were
