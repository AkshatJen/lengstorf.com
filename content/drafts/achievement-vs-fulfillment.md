What is the difference between _achievement_ and _fulfillment_?

My parents bought me all sorts of toys when I was a kid. I was spoiled. It was awesome. But I didn't really appreciate them — they didn't mean anything to me.

As I got older, I started making my own money, and I bought my own toys. These toys weren't necessarily better than the toys my parents bought me, but I liked them an awful lot more; they were _mine_; I'd worked for them; I'd paid for them with my own efforts and earnings.

It feels different to _get_ something than it does to _earn_ something.

You know that joke about how we always want the things we can't have?

And that follow-up joke about how we only want things until we can have them, and then we lose interest?

That's because the _efforts we make to achieve our goals are more fulfilling than the goals themselves_.

I don't like to have stuff. But I _love_ to find a way to get stuff.

Before my adult morals had grown in, I didn't really understand how relationships worked. I was addicted to the problem-solving challenge of convincing someone to love me, but once I'd convinced them to love me, the relationship faltered.

There were two separate things happening:

1. My quest to convince a girl that she wanted to date me.
2. The actual relationship that resulted from my quest.

The quest was exciting: there was a challenge, and I had to solve puzzles — when should I call? what should I say? am I striking the right balance between interested and independent? — in order to achieve my goal of convincing another human that I was worthy of a relationship.

But after I'd achieved that goal, I had to face a different set of questions: did I actually want to be in a relationship with this person? or had I taken on the challenge for its own sake?

And because I was an asshole in high school,[^asshole] I was usually guilty of wanting the challenge, but not the outcome of that challenge.

[^asshole]:
    I'm still an asshole, but I'm slowly learning how to identify — in advance! — when something I'm considering will hurt other people.

In business, I fall into a lot of the same traps.

Sure, I _really_ want to figure out how to get people to trust me with more responsibility — but do I actually _want_ that extra responsibility?

The challenge of convincing a company to trust me with their money, their business, or any other contribution to their bottom line is alluring, and the possibility of a higher achievement is seductive.

But if I achieve that goal, will it make me happy? Will I be fulfilled if I convince a Fortune 500 company to let me manage the production of one of their teams? 

Probably not. I'll probably be miserable because I'd be tied up in red tape and management — hardly the way I'd choose to spend my time.

So the quest for achievement could lead me to a _decrease_ in fulfillment.

---

The goal, then, should be to start with the outcomes.

If we accept every chase, we stand to achieve a lot.

But if we don't think about the responsibilities — if we don't think about the long-term consequences — of those achievements, we can't be sure our lives will become more fulfilling. And in a lot of cases, we might actually make our lives _less_ fulfilling.

Will angling for a promotion be an exciting challenge? Absolutely. Will the increased responsibility and new duties make the job more fulfilling? Maybe — it'll require consideration and clarifying questions.

The actor who played Farva in _Super Troopers_ was chasing an achievement when he fell into an escalation of dares which, ultimately, led to him doing a full-frontal nude scene in the movie.

The thrill of the achievement — in this case, showing his friends that he had the balls[^dad-joke] to get naked on camera — lured him in. There was excitement, and a short-term gain of out-badassing his castmates.

[^dad-joke]:
    Literally! Ha! Okay, fine. I'll head back to [r/dadjokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes) where I'm appreciated.

But the long-term effects — the immortalization of Farva's sugar-coated schlong — may not be as fulfilling.

How to separate the thrill of the chase from the long-term fulfillment of an achievement:

### 1. Why does this excite me?
