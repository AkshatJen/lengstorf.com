There's this idea in American culture[^worldwide] that's so pervasive we tend to accept it as fact:

[^worldwide]:
    As I've traveled the world, I've realized this is a global problem: everywhere I go, I see signs of the [Overkill Cult]({{< ref "blog/overkill-cult.md" >}}) at work.

> In order to get ahead, you've got to be willing to hustle harder than everyone else, and grind it out through long hours and late nights.

We see it everywhere, celebrated as the highest virtue: t-shirts and posters that just say HUSTLE in a cool, hand-lettered font.

    This design is really cool, but what type of culture is it reflecting?

### Hustle & Grind can be poisonous if it's not balanced.

I hustled _hard_ for over a decade: I started multiple businesses, grew my client network, and built a reputation for myself.

I powered through when I felt exhaustion creeping in. _What's a few hours of sleep now_, I chided myself, _compared to becoming wildly successful in the future?_

I stayed on my grizzly[^grizzly] through weekends and holidays and late nights.

[^grizzly]:
    I can say that because I'm part bear.

And while I was ostensibly successful — I had a little money, I'd earned a little recognition — I was also seeing real consequences: I gained a _lot_ of weight, I rarely saw my friends or family, and then there was the curious matter of [_my fucking beard turning white and falling out in patches_]({{< ref "blog/overkill-cult.md" >}}).

**To hustle without clear goals and defined downtime is just as dangerous as unchecked sloth.**

To grind without limits — without sanity checks in place — will bring us as many setbacks as it will advantages.

## The Truth: We Should Hustle Enough and Grind a Little

If I'd never hustled, I wouldn't have my current skill set or network. If I wasn't willing to grind through tough problems, I might have given up a long time ago.

So I'm not in any way advocating the abandonment of hustling to get ahead, or grinding to finish the hard things.

### But without limits, Hustle & Grind hits a point of diminishing returns.

Hustle & Grind is a critical part of "making it" — especially as an entrepreneur or freelancer. However — and this is a _huge_ however — **there comes a point where you've hustled enough; any additional hustling will do very little to move the needle, but will do a _lot_ to harm your mental and/or physical wellbeing.**

Consider this: when you're cooking a steak, you need to apply heat to make it delicious. But if you continue to apply the heat past a certain point, you're only damaging the meal; the additional heat doesn't make the steak _more_ edible, but it _does start to decrease_ how delicious that steak will taste.

    Would you prefer a steak that’s cooked just the right amount? Or one that’s cooked to the point of being chewy, dry, and flavorless?

The secret to a delicious steak is finding the sweet spot between "not cooked" and "overcooked" — the point where it's not too much, and not too little, but _juuuuuuuuuuust right_. **The Goldilocks Zone.**[^gz]

[^gz]:
    This is also the term used by scientists to describe [the required planetary conditions for sustaining life](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/02oct_goldilocks/), and by the [_Mythbusters_](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/the-goldilocks-zone/) to describe the amount of explosives that's not too underwhelming, but not so overboard that it blows everything to hell.

That Goldilocks Zone varies from person to person. I like my steaks just a hint shy of medium-rare; my dad would happily take a bite out of a live cow; my mom likes her beef served _a la_ brick of charcoal.

### We should aim for maximum results and maximum happiness.

The same applies for Hustle & Grind. There's a Goldilocks Zone where the effort being made yields great results, and the reward and enjoyment for making that effort is high.

With too little effort, we might feel restless or lazy.

Too much, and we start to burn out without all that much more output to show for it. And while "too much" is going to mean something different for everyone,[^limits] that limit exists for all of us.

[^limits]:
    For example, I know I'm good for about 6 hours in 90-minute bursts, with actual breaks in between. If I try to power through in a dead sprint, I've got _maybe_ 4 hours before I start to collapse in on myself.

If we want to be truly happy — to _really_ get that life we all set out to make for ourselves through our work — **we have to find our Goldilocks Zone: where we make enough progress to feel that our efforts are paying off, and where we get a huge amount of satisfaction from the work.**

## How to Find Your Goldilocks Zone at Work

TKTK

### Make the maximum possible impact in the minimum possible time frame.

TKTK

### Follow through with non-lucrative hobbies.

Practice guitar. Cook. Go camping. Learn to ride a unicycle. Join an ultimate frisbee team. Take up hand-lettering. Build furniture. Plant a garden. Play pickup games of basketball. Learn to throw a pot. Draw something.

There's an incredible joy in doing something that exists strictly for its own sake.

Our jobs have stakes: if we do them, we eat and pay our bills and have money to go out; if not, we struggle and scrape and stress out.

But there are no stakes for me drawing a picture of myself as a bear. So if I do it, it's being done purely for the smile it'll put on my face to see what I look like as a bear.

Having a hobby with no reward beyond the thing itself gives us something to look forward to _after_ work.

#### Hobbies are not wasted time.

One of my biggest challenges with avoiding overwork is the fear of wasting time.

I think to myself, _If I'm not working, what the hell else will I do?_

And when my only hobby was what I did for work, that was a fair question. I'd end up sitting restlessly, watching Netflix, feeling guilty that I wasn't working because _this_ felt like a colossal waste of time.

But with a hobby, I've got something to look forward to. My time out of work has purpose.

And that makes it _far easier_ to stop working when it's time to stop working.
