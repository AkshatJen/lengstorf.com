At least three times a year, I want to give up, quit, and disappear.

I find myself running logistics for ghosting: new name, new place, new *everything*. I just fade into the background and leave nothing but a fade-to-question-mark in my old life.

***

Usually I feel it coming: the desire to burn it down and start over. It creeps in around the edges when my projects are all well underway, my relationships all stable, my life under control.

It shows up when everything is "just fine" and I have no problems to speak of.

All the fires are out. All the todos are checked off. All the dragons are slain.

This is what I always told myself I was working toward. This should be the peaceful repose that accompanies reaching my goals. Isn't this success? Haven't I just succeeded? [Shouldn't I be happy now?]({{< ref "blog/finding-happiness.md" >}})

Why, then, do I feel so *fucking awful*?

When the only thing that's hard about being alive is not sounding like a whiner when you can't understand why your decidedly *un*hard life doesn't seem all that fulfilling, you learn to shut your mouth.

Speaking up about the problems that arise from other problems' solutions is not a smart thing to do. At least not if you want to avoid public ridicule.

And it's not like you're ungrateful. You know, even at your lowest moments, that your life is not now, nor will it ever (probably) be, bad. You don't like to say "lucky" because it implies you just fell face-first into everything you have, but there's no denying that you've had no shortage of opportunities.

Still, disillusionment sits in the darker corners of your mind, brooding and terrible, gnawing on the wiring.

*I thought there'd be more than this,* it whispers. *Is this as far as I can go?*

So you sit at the end of a path that promised fulfillment, and you're hit by the gut-dropping realization that you're only thirty years old but you're more or less out of ideas. Now that you're standing on the precipice of the best ending you could imagine for yourself — you, with that special intellect that was so advanced, so different from all the others, the weak, the "normies" — your best-case outcomes are feeling more like cheap trophies that no one could (or should) possibly care about longer than it'll take them to write your obituary.

And you can still count on another forty years or so of being alive.

So you're sitting with your feet dangling over the edge of the void, dark and empty and endless, a yawning expanse of nothing in the exact spot where you were *so sure* all the answers would be.

Disillusionment slumps down beside you and moans, *What now?*

And you only just squeeze out, "I don't know," past the tightness in your throat.

***

There's no way to bring it up without sounding ungrateful.

"What do I do next, now that I've achieved all my goals? I feel lost and sad and directionless."

So you bottle it up. Tell yourself you're just being irrational.

After all, you *do* have it pretty good. You've got good people around you; you make enough money; you wrote the rules for the life you're living.

And maybe that's the problem. You gave up your scapegoat when you killed God and fled the country.

This shitty feeling that nothing is quite right? *You created it.*

This whole world of yours — your little solipsistic slice of heaven — you hammered in each nail yourself, and if it feels more like a coffin than a rumpus room, well, maybe you should have thought harder about how you framed up the walls.
