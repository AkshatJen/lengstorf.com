At least three times a year, I want to give up, quit, and disappear.

I find myself running logistics for ghosting: new name, new place, new *everything*. I just fade into the background and leave nothing but a fade-to-question-mark in my old life.

***

Usually I feel it coming: the desire to burn it down and start over. It creeps in around the edges when my projects are all well underway, my relationships all stable, my life under control.

It shows up when everything is "just fine" and I have no problems to speak of.

All the fires are out. All the todos are checked off. All the [dragons are slain]({{< ref "slaying-dragons.md" >}}).

This is what I always told myself I was working toward. This should be the peaceful repose that accompanies reaching my goals. Isn't this success? Haven't I just succeeded? [Shouldn't I be happy now?]({{< ref "blog/finding-happiness.md" >}})

Why, then, do I feel so *fucking awful*?

***

When the only thing that's hard about being alive is not sounding like a whiner when you can't understand why your decidedly _not_ hard life doesn't seem all that fulfilling, you learn to shut your mouth.

Speaking up about the problems that arise from other problems' solutions is not a smart thing to do. At least not if you want to avoid public ridicule.

And it's not like you're ungrateful. You know, even at your lowest moments, that your life is not now, nor will it ever (probably) be, _actually_ bad. You don't like to say "lucky" because it implies you just fell face-first into everything you have, but there's no denying that you've had no shortage of opportunities.

Still, disillusionment sits in the darker corners of your mind, brooding and terrible, gnawing on the wiring.

*I thought there'd be more than this,* it whispers. *Is this as far as I can go?*

So you sit at the end of a path that promised fulfillment, and you're hit by the gut-dropping realization that you're only thirty years old but you're more or less out of ideas. Now that you're standing on the precipice of the best ending you could imagine for yourself — you, with that special intellect that was so advanced, so different from all the others: the coasters, the weak-willed, the "normies" — your best-case outcomes are feeling more like cheap trophies that no one could (or should) care about longer than the few minutes it'll take to write your obituary.

And you can still count on another forty years or so of being alive.

So you're sitting with your feet dangling over the edge of the void, dark and empty and endless, a yawning expanse of nothing in the exact spot where you were *so sure* all the answers would be.

Disillusionment slumps down beside you and moans, *What now?*

And you only just squeeze out, "I don't know," past the tightness in your throat.

***

There's no way to bring it up without sounding ungrateful.

"What do I do next, now that I've achieved all my goals? I feel lost and sad and directionless."

So you bottle it up. Tell yourself you're just being irrational.

After all, you *do* have it pretty good. You've got good people around you; you make enough money; you wrote the rules for the life you're living.

And maybe that's the problem. You gave up your scapegoats when you killed God, became your own boss, and fled the country.

This shitty feeling that nothing is quite right? *You created it.*

This whole world of yours — your little solipsistic slice of heaven — you hammered in each nail yourself, and if it feels more like a coffin than a rumpus room, well, maybe you should have thought harder about how you framed up the walls.

***

It doesn't make sense, this hollow feeling, but then again it makes perfect sense: you've been looking at things all wrong, like somehow [you'd hit this high and never come down]({{< ref "baseline.md" >}}).

Rationally, you knew that wasn't the case — but you never really took the time to think about it rationally, now did you?

***

## NOTES:

What are the causes of this feeling?

1.  Bad expectation setting. What did you expect? That you'd work really hard, 
    hit a certain level of success, and then never do anything again — and somehow find that fulfilling? You're an ambitious person, dipshit; sitting still makes you crazy.

2.  Lack of challenge. After meeting a minimum level of comfort and security 
    (add reference!), your happiness is no longer tied to your income. So yeah, #richpeopleproblems and all that, but also recognize the reality you're in and look for something that challenges and excites you.

3.  Purposelessness. Your work doesn't need to be world-changing, but 
    _something_ you do should probably matter. Matter to you, at least. If your job is feeling meaningless and that makes you feel bad, look for a job that _doesn't_ feel meaningless. Or, if you don't want to give up the job, find something that matters to you and do it in your down time — because [you're not working crazy hours anymore]({{< ref "overtime-hurts-productivity.md" >}}) and you've got plenty of down time, right?

4.  Isolation. [Working remotely]({{< ref "remote-work-everyoone-wins.md" >}}) 
    leaves you in a position to do great work, but it also means a lot of what you do happens in a vacuum. And no matter how much you try to pretend that you're both a rock _and_ an island, you need to share with someone. And Marisa only cares so much about whatever technical bullshit you're spouting, so you need a community of people who share your interest in turbonerdery.
   
5.  No collaboration. When you learn something, it makes your life better. But i
    if you don't share it, that lesson dies with you. Go out and share what you've learned — preferably in person, because you're a fucking human person and human contact is good for you — and make the world a better place. Even if the improvement is as small as a better way to organize code.
    
    And while you're at it, listen and learn. Yes, you're very smart, but shut up once in a while and recognize that in more ways than not you're still very dumb. Other people will happily share learned lessons with you if you'd only shut the fuck up and let them talk.

6.  Poor metrics of success. You're always preaching about [how important it is 
    to have clear metrics]({{< ref "results-based-work.md" >}}), and yet here we are: you've effectively defined "success" as an amorphous blob of warm fuzzies, and now that you're actually thinking about it you're realizing you can't actually be sure what most of your "definitions" of success even _are_, let alone whether or not you've met them. So sit down, think hard, and decide what really matters — in a concrete, true-or-false kind of way — so you can have clear targets to shoot for. (Also, that'll give you a sense of purpose again, because you'll have real, concrete goals.)
