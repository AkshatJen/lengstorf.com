## What's the Point of This Post?

It's commonly held that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. This is discouraging, because — assuming you're working full-time (40 hours/week) on the skill — it takes five full years before you have any hope of being considered "an expert". **However, for many fields, we've _already_ put in a good portion of those 10,000 hours through our other studies, activities, and experiences.** So hitting 10,000 hours may take less time than you think.
