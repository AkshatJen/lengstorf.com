"I don't have five fucking years to learn a new skill," she says.

This is happening in Thailand. We're in a tiny condo at the top floor of a high rise in Chiang Mai's trendy Nimman area. The guy on Airbnb called it a penthouse, but in reality it's an extra floor that was hastily assembled on top of an existing building, and the elevators only go to the floor below. On the inside it's decorated with the same wood paneling my grandma's house used to have. Not that we're complaining; the [rent is, like, $400]({{< ref "cost-of-living-remotely.md" >}}).

Marisa hurls herself onto the bed in a fit of Tiny Rage™[^tiny-rage] and screams her frustration into a pillow.

[^tiny-rage]:

    Marisa is 4′11″. Our difference in height is ridiculous, as illustrated in the photo to the right.

    Her strong opinions and willingness to defend them are a huge part of why I like her so much. However, the sadistic part of me knows that she's easy to wind up, like a spaniel. Sometimes I deliberately wind her up, then watch her curls angrily shake as she explains why my ridiculous suggestion is, in fact, ridiculous.

    Does this make me an asshole? Probably.

    Will I stop? Absolutely not.

"Where are you getting five years?" I ask, puzzled.

"From fucking Malcolm Gladwell!"[^curse-words]

    Also, Marisa curses like a sailor when the mood strikes.

## The 10,000 Hour Rule

In [_Outliers_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANYDAO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), Malcolm Gladwell takes the research of Anders Ericsson, [oversimplifies a bit](http://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/malcolm_gladwell_got_us_wrong_our_research_was_key_to_the_10000_hour_rule_but_heres_what_got_oversimplified/), and contributes a new phrase to the collected folk knowledge of western society: **The 10,000 Hour Rule**.

The short version goes like this: in order to become an expert at something, you need 10,000 hours of practice.

Working 40 hours a week, we get roughly 2,000 hours in each year, so if our full-time job is learning a new skill, it should take roughly five years to become an expert.

At least this is what Marisa landed on, using Gladwell's 10,000 Hour Rule and a little bit of math.

They say it takes 10,000 hours to become great at something.[^10k-hours]

[^10k-hours]:
    Malcolm Gladwell took the 10,000-hour rule mainstream. Later, the rule was debunked — or at least heavily asterisked — by the researchers who did the studies Gladwell based his work on. For the purposes of this post, none of that shit matters; this post only digs into perception.

If we figure a full-time job adds up to about 2,000 hours a year, that means it would take us roughly five years to get good at something new, assuming we could work on it for _eight hours a day_.

This sounds hard.

"I can't switch careers," we might say, "I can't afford to live for five years while I build up a new skill set."

And if it's a hobby, like learning an instrument or jiu jitsu? No chance: it'd take 100 years to become great with two hours a week of classes.

## What's the Point of This Post?

It's commonly held that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. This is discouraging, because — assuming you're working full-time (40 hours/week) on the skill — it takes five full years before you have any hope of being considered "an expert". **However, for many fields, we've _already_ put in a good portion of those 10,000 hours through our other studies, activities, and experiences.** So hitting 10,000 hours may take less time than you think.

## We've All Heard the 10,000 Hours Rule

Never mind that [the 10,000 hour rule is a gross oversimplification](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10000-hour-rule-wrong-really-master-skill/).

Tell Marisa's story: moving from HR to UX — thought she was starting from scratch. Actually, she was already doing 75% of the kinds of work that would be required.

Talk about my story: playing music and helping manage the band taught me a lot of what I needed to know to start a freelance business; selling vacuums taught me how to sell (and how _not_ to sell) to potential clients.

You're almost _never_ starting at zero hours of experience.
