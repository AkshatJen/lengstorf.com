## What's the Point of This Post?

It's commonly held that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. This is discouraging, because — assuming you're working full-time (40 hours/week) on the skill — it takes five full years before you have any hope of being considered "an expert". **However, for many fields, we've _already_ put in a good portion of those 10,000 hours through our other studies, activities, and experiences.** So hitting 10,000 hours may take less time than you think.

## We've All Heard the 10,000 Hours Rule

Never mind that [the 10,000 hour rule is a gross oversimplification](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10000-hour-rule-wrong-really-master-skill/).

Tell Marisa's story: moving from HR to UX — thought she was starting from scratch. Actually, she was already doing 75% of the kinds of work that would be required.

Talk about my story: playing music and helping manage the band taught me a lot of what I needed to know to start a freelance business; selling vacuums taught me how to sell (and how _not_ to sell) to potential clients.

You're almost _never_ starting at zero hours of experience.
