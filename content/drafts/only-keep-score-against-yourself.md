If our self-worth is tied to what other people are capable of, we'll always be miserable.

Instead, we should measure against our past selves:

1. Yesterday Me
2. Last Month Me
3. Last Year Me
4. Five Years Ago Me

Am I doing something today to make me better than yesterday? Than last month? Than last year? Than five years ago?

If so, I'm working toward becoming a better human. If I feel I should be doing more, that's fine. But if I only feel I should be doing more because Mark Zuckerberg was a millionaire by twenty-something, that's fruitless self-abuse.

And on the flipside, if I'm comforting myself because I'm doing "better than most" — you know, watching reality TV and smugly thinking, _Well, at least I'm not as fucked up as these idiots._ — then I'm making excuses for my own lack of effort.

There will always be someone doing better than us — even the smartest quantum physicist in the world probably sucks at ping pong, or cooking, or fixing the lawn mower — and there will always be people who are doing worse than us. Making those comparisons will only bum us out, or lull us into a false sense of superiority.

Measure against yourself. Only yourself. Be better than Yesterday You every day. That's you only metric for success.
