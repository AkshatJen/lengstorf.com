How do we know when we're successful?

There's no formal award ceremony[^chewie] denoting success. And if you've ever subjected yourself to the horrors of reality television, a few minutes of watching the petty competitiveness of _The Real Housewives_ makes it pretty obvious that "owning a giant pile of expensive shit" doesn't necessarily make you feel successful.

[^chewie]:
    But if there was, the wookie would get a medal.

The fluidity of success — or, more precisely, _feeling successful_ — has been on my mind recently, due mostly to [some big changes](http://www.2ftat.com/episode/07-change-and-labels/) I've been contemplating.

Over the course of multiple conversations on the topic, the feeling of success has proven to be a fascinatingly maddening subject: everyone wants it, but its meaning and measure is inifinitely varied.

So let's try to pin it down, yeah?

## Success, Objectively. I Am Successful Because...

On the surface, it seems like success shouldn't be too hard to nail down. After all, there are 

### ...I am not on fire.

The lack of immediate danger is a sure sign of success, right?

We're not dangerously hot or cold. We have something to eat. We

How do we know if we're doing okay in life?

**Is our "okayness" determined by the relative level of danger in our lives?** "Well, I'm not on fire, and I have a sandwich, and nothing is hunting me. So... yes?"

**Is "okayness" a product of being better or worse than other people?** "I have this season's designer shoes, but my jacket is from last year. He has the hot new jacket. But _his_ shoes are knock-offs.

"Shit. Do shoes trump jackets?"

**Is "okayness" measured by how much wealth we've collected?** "I have lots of monies. "

If our self-worth is tied to what other people are capable of, we'll always be miserable.

Instead, we should measure against our past selves:

1. Yesterday Me
2. Last Month Me
3. Last Year Me
4. Five Years Ago Me

Am I doing something today to make me better than yesterday? Than last month? Than last year? Than five years ago?

If so, I'm working toward becoming a better human. If I feel I should be doing more, that's fine. But if I only feel I should be doing more because Mark Zuckerberg was a millionaire by twenty-something, that's fruitless self-abuse.

And on the flipside, if I'm comforting myself because I'm doing "better than most" — you know, watching reality TV and smugly thinking, _Well, at least I'm not as fucked up as these idiots._ — then I'm making excuses for my own lack of effort.

There will always be someone doing better than us — even the smartest quantum physicist in the world probably sucks at ping pong, or cooking, or fixing the lawn mower — and there will always be people who are doing worse than us. Making those comparisons will only bum us out, or lull us into a false sense of superiority.

Measure against yourself. Only yourself. Be better than Yesterday You every day. That's your only metric for success.
