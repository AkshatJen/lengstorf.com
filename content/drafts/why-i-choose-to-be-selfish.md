I'm probably the most selfish person you'll ever meet.

I only do things I want to do. I pointedly avoid anything that doesn't make me happy. I work painstakingly to eliminate anything from my life that doesn't meet my selfish goals.

## I Wasn't Always So Selfish

As a kid, I spent _all_ of my time trying to make other people happy. I'd dress how they dressed, talk how they talked, do what they did. In eighth grade, I drove my cousin completely crazy because I'd even develop crushes on the same girls he had crushes on.

### Please please please like me.

_I lived to please other people._ All I wanted was to be popular. To be loved. So I bent myself into a pretzel trying to anticipate the needs of the people I so desperately wanted to validate me.

Unsurprisingly, this backfired spectacularly. I always felt like a faker — because I _was_ a faker. And the people with whom I was trying to ingratiate myself either took no notice or were actively repelled by my cloying attitude.

I felt slighted; _after all I do for you, you're going to treat me like this?_

### No one likes a suck-up.

My self-immolating efforts to buy others' affections left me more alone than when I'd started. Eventually, I turned bitter and blamed _them:_ the ingrates who would cast aside someone so selfless, so caring, so _nice_.

### This is why we can't have nice things.

So I developed a new outlook on life: _fuck 'em_.

If they weren't going to appreciate all the things I could do for them, then I'd just do all that nice shit _for me_ instead. And they could all suck it.

And just like that, I became happier and — surprisingly — a little bit popular.

## What Being Selfish Means to Me

When I made the transition to Total Selfishness, things changed for me. I felt control over my own life, and finally learned what it meant to be respected by other people.

I made a lot of rookie mistakes on the way, but through trial and error, I landed on three key rules that guide all of my decisions.

### 1. When I spend time with you, it's because you bring something valuable to my life.

If I'm going to spend my time with you, I need to be sure I'm getting something in return for it.

So what do you have to offer? Does your life experience complement mine in a way that helps me improve? Do you push me to challenge myself? Do you know any jokes?[^joke]

[^joke]:
    Last year we bought a fake Christmas tree, and the guy behind the counter asked my dad, "Are you going to put this up yourself?"<br><br>My dad said, "Don't be disgusting. I'm going to put it in the living room."

If I can't come up with a benefit, I'm going to decline the invitation. Nothing personal; I'm just being selfish.

### 2. When I do something nice for you, it's because doing so makes me happier.

When I gave you that gift, it's because the look on your face made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I know that in giving you a gift, I've dug myself a little deeper into your heart. I'm banking positive karma.

I wanted to feel like a nice person, and when I did something nice for you, you gave me that feeling.

If doing something nice for you is going to make me feel put out or inconvenienced, I'm going to pass. Again, nothing personal; I'm just being selfish.

### 3. When I agree to a project, it's because I believe it will make my life better.

When I took on this project, it's because I saw good things for me in its wake. More money, more experience, more influence.

Why should I bother with a new project if I don't get anything in return? What can this project do _for me?_ Because I don't need to be busy — I need to be _better_.

And if this project can't move me further along the path to being an improved version of myself, then why would I waste my time. When I turn down a useless project, it _is_ a little bit personal; I'm kind of offended you'd bring that nonsense in here.

## Why Selfishness Gets a Bad Rap

If you want to hurt someone's feelings, a go-to insult is to fire off something like, "Why are you being so _selfish_ right now?"

Selfishness is hardly considered a good thing, and that's really too bad — because everything that gets attributed to selfishness really isn't all that selfish.

### 1. Lie #1: Choosing something good for me necessarily mandates that it's bad for someone else.

There's a misguided belief that life is a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). When I make a selfish decision, the knee-jerk response is to assume that my decision was made at someone else's expense.

But that's not how it works for humans in most cases. Because — unlike real problems, where a gazelle becomes dinner lest a lion starves — people's problems are largely imaginary. And that means we can all win, if we imagine hard enough.

### 2. Lie #2: Spending time with someone because they bring value to my life means I'm using them.

People use words like "utilitarian" with a derogatory slant — especially when referring to relationships. Utilitarian relationships conjure up sugar daddies and gold diggers, social climbers and sycophants — but that's a pretty unhealthy sort of utilitarianism.

The idea of only spending time with someone who adds value to my life _should_ be our default mode of thinking. Unfortunately, because no one wants to be accused of "using people", we recoil from the idea that our relationships with other people are transactional.

But they are. Even if you want to deny it with your entire being.

### 3. Lie #3: Acting selfishly means I don't ever do anything to help others.

If you believe the venomous accusations that accompany most descriptions of selfish acts, you might get the idea that selfish people are only able to find their happiness by taking someone else's: they stalk down the street, knocking books to the ground, stealing ice cream cones, and deflating dreams.

That's a nasty world, though, and one that a truly selfish person would never wish on themselves. If you follow the logic, the idea that selfish people are cruel actually doesn't make _any_ sense.

## The Truth About Selfishness




### 1. Truly selfish people play the long game: I choose things that are good for me _and_ you.

People's problems are mostly imaginary: we strive for ranks (that other people made up) like "general" or "CEO" or "[Level Five Laser Lotus](http://community-sitcom.wikia.com/wiki/Reformed_Neo_Buddhism)"; we compete to amass shiny rocks — or, more accurately, a digital representation of a bank-issued IOU that promises a given quantity of said shiny rocks is held on your behalf; we work tirelessly to best each other in our collections of "authentic" trinkets so we can prove just how "authentic" we are.

Each of these imaginary problems creates the illusion of competition: I need to have a higher spot on the ladder than you; my bank balance needs to be higher than yours; my [ornamental hermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_hermit) needs to be more unkempt and cantankerous than yours.

But by stepping outside the imaginary competition for a second, it's possible to see — nay, to _imagine_ — another outcome: one in which my life gets better _and_ your life gets better.

Taking a vow of poverty doesn't prevent other people from suffering in poverty. Bill Gates getting _stupidly_ rich, though, [made a difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation).

Sure, he got rich, and that was a selfish endeavor. But now he can — selfishly — apply his ridiculous wealth toward improving the world in the ways that make him feel best about his legacy. Selfishly making the world a better place.

### 2. Spending time with people who add no value to my life hurts everyone involved.

In high school I used to hang out with this girl who didn't like me very much. I was her backup boyfriend: I existed to fill the cracks in her relationship. I told myself I was making an investment in the relationship — she'd see how great I was, and later, she'd see that the guy she was with was a jerk, and finally she'd realize I was perfect for her.

Over time, it became apparent that she'd never feel that way about me. And at first, that caused a _lot_ of resentment in me. I felt like she _owed me_ a fair shot as her boyfriend. I was angry that she didn't see how great I was, or how hard I worked to keep her happy.

But that resentment should have been pointed at me: _I_ was the one who had supported a relationship that didn't make me happy; it was _my fault_ that I kept making sacrifices for her that she neither appreciated nor reciprocated.

She wasn't a bad person. I was a sucker.

But because I was a sucker, I now felt this resentment that became hatred for a girl who really was only guilty of being sixteen and selfish. She found out she could date the exciting, dangerous guy she was attracted to because the safe, caring guy (me) was willing to take care of her emotionally without any effort on her part.[^eventualities]

[^eventualities]:
    Of course, her selfishness in this case was short-sighted, because accepting my sacrificial charity eventually led to resentment from me, which caused stress for everyone involved when I finally lost my shit and made a scene after third period.

What _really_ needed to change was that I needed to realize that investing in a relationship that held no benefit for me — at least, nothing outside a one-sided hope that _maybe_ some day it would be what I wanted it to be — was only going to hurt me _and_ this girl I told myself I cared about.

When I felt like shit because she dumped one douchebag and started dating another after deftly ignoring the hints I dropped about becoming her boyfriend, my resentment was poisonous. I felt horrible, and then I tried to make her feel horrible. It destroyed our relationship, and — since I was a teenager who wasn't ready to learn anything about myself — installed a massive chip on my shoulder that poisoned my relationships with women for the next ten years.

In more recent relationships, I only put in what I know I'll get back out. It sounds transactional, but if I let that balance skew, one of us is going to start building up that resentment that eventually destroys relationships.

If I spend time with a person, I need to walk away from that interaction feeling like I could never see them again and be totally fine with it. No "they owe me" or "I got screwed" — I need to be able to say, "We hung out for a while, and it was cool. At some point we drifted apart, I guess. I hope they're doing well, wherever they are."

I invested time and emotional effort and whatever else, and I was repaid _instantly_ with company and entertainment and maybe love or another connection. There was no imbalance in the exchange. No winner. No giver and no taker. Just two people who had a pleasant time together, who feel no obligations, who're owed no debts.

### 3. Being selfish is the only way to _stay_ compassionate.

The common accusation that a selfish person hurts the people around them is ass-backward. The logic just doesn't make sense.

Imagine this scenario: there's a plate of cookies, still warm out of the oven. The walls are practically dripping with fresh-baked cookie smell. You're the first person in a the group to enter the room, and you have about twenty minutes before the next person shows up. You're starving, and the cookies are your favorite kind.

What would a selfish person do in this circumstance?

It's easy to assume someone selfish would eat all the cookies. "That's what everyone else gets for being slow," she'd mutter between delicious mouthfuls. "The early bird gets the gooey chocolatey delicious snacks."

When the rest of the party arrives, smells the cookies, and realizes that they've been screwed out of cookies by the "selfish" actions of this person, the seeds of resentment and disrespect are planted, and each cookie-scented deep breath nurtures that anger.

Our cookie-eating "selfish" jerk has just been trusted for the last time by this group. She'll never be left alone with tasty treats (or anything of value, for that matter). She's lost credibility and likability.

In the short term, she had a few extra bites of cookie.

In the long term, she destroyed critical social indicators and relationships.

Eating the cookies was _not_ selfish; it was myopic and foolish.

A _truly_ selfish person recognizes that short-term gains rarely outweigh long-term consequences — the selfish move in this case would be to make sure everyone in the group gets a cookie. The temporary loss in bites-of-cookie-per-minute is more than reclaimed in long-term relationship stability and trust.

#### How I learned this (by fucking it up).

My high school was small — 150 kids or so in my graduating class — which meant there was no avoiding love triangles.[^rhombi]

[^rhombi]:
    Or love rhombuses (rhombi?), or even love hexagons, for that matter. The complicated shapes of our sticky teenage fondlings were a primary driver in our understanding of geometry.

I rode the bus to school — my punishment for having earned my parents a spot on the vice principal's speed dial — which is where I met Candice and Jenny.

Candice and Jenny were step-sisters, only a few months apart in age, and they tended to compete with each other in pretty much everything. When Candice developed a crush on me, Jenny started flirting with me immediately. One would sneak looks at me while the other wasn't paying attention. I'd find cute notes in my backpack. Candice poked fun at Jenny's big ears. Jenny attacked Candice's character by telling me she was easy.[^protip]

[^protip]:
    #protip: Telling a teenage boy that your rival is easy will _absolutely_ backfire. Just sayin', Jenny.

They were playful, at first, but once we started exchanging furtive hand squeezes in passing, I started to come under pressure to make my choice.

And I, infallible as always, decided that the only fair way to choose was to lie to everyone and see if they'd _both_ make out with me. Which they did. And then bragged to each other about it. And realized they'd been played. And united in an all-out assault on my reputation.

They called it selfish, my lying and trying to hook up with them both, but that decision was one of my more spectacularly self-destructive efforts. In the wake of my dishonesty, I lost face not only with Candice and Jenny, but with all of their friends — and with less than a hundred girls in the class, the news didn't take long to travel.

I wasn't making out with _anyone_ after that — at least not until someone else in my class did something equally stupid to take the heat off me.

---

Later, I learned how being selfish works in relationships like that: you say what you want, openly and honestly, fully understanding that if what you're asking for doesn't line up with what the other person is willing to give, and vice versa, then the relationship may dissolve instantly.

In dating, when I wanted to stay single, I'd say, plainly, "I'm dating other people, and for right now that's not something I want to stop doing." And sometimes, my Tinder date was cool with it — the honesty avoided the space where expectations could be set improperly and later violated.

The "selfish" thing to do would have been to wait until _after_ we'd hooked up to bring up the whole I'm-not-looking-for-anything-serious talk. But the short-term gain (booty) doesn't outweigh the long-term consequences (hurt feelings, new enemies).

The truly selfish thing to do was to have that talk during the first drink of the evening. The short-term risk (no booty) was far outweighed by the long-term benefits (casual relationships with a clear lack of expectations).

---

The secret to selfishness is to look at cumulative gain, and always choose the outcome with the highest cumulative gain.

If I skew the math so my friends cover more of my costs than they'd consider fair, I gain a little cash in the short-term, but lose the trust of my friends — and maybe lose my friends altogether — in the long term. The selfish decision is to keep things fair to preserve a solid relationship with my friends; as a result we can trust and depend on each other down the road, building a strong social support structure for me.

If I cheat on my girlfriend, I gain the excitement of sex with a different person in the short-term, but over the long-term it costs me the burden of guilt, the erosion of trust, and the highly probable loss of my girlfriend. The selfish decision is to turn down an unrewarding hook-up; as a result my girlfriend knows she can trust me and we avoid the do-you-really-love-me drama, creating a rewarding and stress-free relationship for me (and her).

If I cut corners at work, I see a short-term spike in my free time, but the lowered quality of the output will cost me clients in the long run. The selfish decision is to make every project I deliver something I'd be proud to claim as my own; that means my clients will be happier, and they'll tell other people about me, and I'll end up having new clients and making more money.

The selfish decision is the decision that makes life better. This is not the decision that makes life easier _for the moment:_ not choosing between two tempting options; taking a shortcut. This is the decision that creates a lasting positive impact on you existence: having a difficult conversation now that creates lasting bonds; turning down a momentary pleasure for a long-term reward.
