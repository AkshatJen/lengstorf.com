How can we make the world magical again?

I've written about [the loss of magic in the world]({{< ref "magic.md" >}}) before, but today I want to dig into what _makes_ magic.

## We Need the Baby Bear Amount of Magic

There's a balance to be struck: too little, and we can hear the formula through the song; too much, and no one understands what the hell you're trying to accomplish.

It's a different kind of [Goldilocks Zone]({{< ref "goldilocks-zone.md" >}}) than I've talked about before, but the concept is similar: when you're dealing with magic, you have to get the balance _juuuuust_ right.

### Mama Bear Magic: Too little magic feels predictable.

For an example of how magic makes the difference, let's look at pop music.

Consider two songs. Both are four-chord, standard-issue pop songs. Both feature guest rappers. Both follow the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-out construction. On paper, they're more or less indistinguishable.

And yet one is _Bad Blood_, a Grammy-winning hit from Taylor Swift, and the other is Rebecca Black's _Friday_ — arguably [the most despised song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song)#Critical_reception) of the last twenty years.[^baha-men]

[^baha-men]:
    Or at least since ["Who Let the Dogs Out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkuu0Lwb5EM) was released.

#### “All pop music is so formulaic.” – Every Hipster Ever

One of the standard complaints about pop music is that it's too formulaic.[^guilty] I can't really argue with that — after all, _Bad Blood_ and [just about every other hit since 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin#Billboard_Hot_100_number_one_singles) has been written by the same guy — but this really highlights the importance of magic.

[^guilty]:
    I'm as guilty of this as anyone. I was especially priggish in my late teens, when I'd discovered that there was music in the world that wasn't on the radio — falling victim to [The Learning Trap]({{< ref "2015-11-07_learning-trap.md" >}}) yet again.

#### Yet something sets the Top 40 apart. (Sometimes.)

If all pop songs sound the same, why do some hit the top of the charts, and others become such a firehose of vitriol that [the singer has to drop out of school to avoid bullying](http://www.businessinsider.com/rebecca-black-drop-out-school-bullying-2011-8)?

**Because _magic is everything_ in music.** If you can hear the formula through the song, the magic is gone.

Sure, the bones of Lorde's [_Royals_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlcIKh6sBtc) are nothing we haven't seen before — yet something happened in that song that caught the attention of hipsters and pop audiences alike. And sure, now that we've all heard it a thousand times it doesn't seem so magical, but I remember hearing that song for the first time and stopping everything so I could hear it better.

It had magic.

We saw the same kind of familiar-yet-surprising work from [Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM), the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, David Bowie, Daft Punk, [Frank Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onaWSflUQ0), and Alt-J, 

### Papa Bear Magic: Too much magic just doesn't make any damn sense.

Papa Bear Magic: This thing is _too damn magical_.

If magic is the ability to surprise and captivate us by taking something we've seen before (like music or art) and making it surprising, it's really easy to go _way too far_.

It starts with trying to stand out as an artist, takes a left turn, detaches from reality, and somehow ends with you [nailing your nuts to the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Pavlensky#Fixation) and calling it art.[^david-blaine]

[^david-blaine]:
    I feel the same way about David Blaine's work. Since when is sitting inside an ice cube for three days considered magic?

    I mean, look, pal — I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but maybe don't call me again until you've got a tiger or something, okay?

In music, the same things can happen. You start off by trying to break the traditional formula, tweak the "usual" sounds, and somehow end up making something that sounds less like a song and more like a lightly-choreographed physical assault.
