How can we make the world magical again?

In an older post, I asked, "Is there any [magic left in the world]({{< ref "magic.md" >}})?"

## Magic Is Our Sense of Wonder at Things We Don't Understand

My argument was that magic is the wonder that comes before understanding — and that as we get older, our understanding of the world broadens, which leads to our sense of wonder diminishing proportionately.

And logically, that seems like a good thing, right? Because wonder is _not knowing_ — and it only takes a few seconds in the comments section or a single talking heads segment on the news to see what _not knowing things_ has done for debate.

### We should be working to gain a better understanding of everything.

One of my guiding principles in life is this: **Be curious about everything.**

{{< tweetable via="jlengstorf" >}}Be curious about everything.{{< /tweetable >}}

But I think there's a _huge_ amount of value in a healthy sense of wonder.

### Isn't understanding how stuff works fatal to our sense of wonder?

I want to be curious about everything (to know things), but I want to have a sense of wonder (to _not_ know things).

Are my arguments antithetical to each other? Am I suffering from a debilitating case of <abbr title="American Cognitive Dissonance">ACD</abbr>?[^epidemic]

[^epidemic]:
    American Cognitive Dissonance. It's impossible for me to be sure I'm not infected; one of the earliest symptoms of ACD is an inability to recognize the symptoms of ACD, both in yourself and in anyone who agrees with you.

I don't think so. Working to constantly improve my understanding of the world by [diving into anything that seems interesting]({{< ref "wasted-time.md" >}}) doesn't require that I never feel awed by the things people are capable of. And being blown away by something I don't understand (and therefore feels like magic) doesn't bar me from trying to figure out how the trick was performed.

## We Make Our Own Magic

## But We Need to Be Responsible With Magic

There's a balance to be struck: too little, and we can hear the formula through the song; too much, and no one understands what the hell you're trying to accomplish.

It's a different kind of [Goldilocks Zone]({{< ref "goldilocks-zone.md" >}}) than I've talked about before, but the concept is similar: when you're dealing with magic, you have to get the balance _juuuuust_ right.

### Mama Bear Magic: underwhelming, predictable, and easy to hate.

For an example of how magic makes the difference, let's look at pop music.

Consider two songs. Both are four-chord, standard-issue pop songs. Both feature guest rappers. Both follow the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-out construction. On paper, they're more or less indistinguishable.

{{< youtube QcIy9NiNbmo >}}

And yet one is _Bad Blood_, a Grammy-winning hit from Taylor Swift, and the other is Rebecca Black's _Friday_ — arguably [the most despised song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_(Rebecca_Black_song)#Critical_reception) of the last twenty years.[^baha-men]

[^baha-men]:
    Or at least since ["Who Let the Dogs Out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkuu0Lwb5EM) was released.

#### “All pop music is so formulaic.” – Every Hipster Ever

One of the standard complaints about pop music is that it's too formulaic.[^guilty] I can't really argue with that — after all, _Bad Blood_ and [just about every other hit since 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin#Billboard_Hot_100_number_one_singles) has been written by the same guy — but this really highlights the importance of magic.

[^guilty]:
    I'm as guilty of this as anyone. I was especially priggish in my late teens, when I'd discovered that there was music in the world that wasn't on the radio — falling victim to [The Learning Trap]({{< ref "2015-11-07_learning-trap.md" >}}) yet again.

#### Yet something sets the Top 40 apart. (Sometimes.)

If all pop songs sound the same, why do some hit the top of the charts, and others become such a firehose of vitriol that [the singer has to drop out of school to avoid bullying](http://www.businessinsider.com/rebecca-black-drop-out-school-bullying-2011-8)?

**Because _magic is everything_ in music.** If you can hear the formula through the song, the magic is gone.

Sure, the bones of Lorde's [_Royals_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlcIKh6sBtc) are nothing we haven't seen before — yet something happened in that song that caught the attention of hipsters and pop audiences alike. And sure, now that we've all heard it a thousand times it doesn't seem so magical, but I remember hearing that song for the first time and stopping everything so I could hear it better.

It had magic.

We saw the same kind of familiar-yet-surprising work from [Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM), the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, David Bowie, Daft Punk, [Frank Ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onaWSflUQ0), and Alt-J.

### Papa Bear Magic: no one knows what the hell you're doing.

Papa Bear Magic: This thing is _too damn magical_.

If magic is the ability to surprise and captivate us by taking something we've seen before (like music or art) and making it surprising, it's really easy to go _way too far_.

It starts with trying to stand out as an artist, takes a left turn, detaches from reality, and somehow ends with you [nailing your nuts to the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Pavlensky#Fixation) and calling it art.[^david-blaine]

[^david-blaine]:
    I feel the same way about David Blaine's work. Since when is sitting inside an ice cube for three days considered magic?

    I mean, look, pal — I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but maybe don't call me again until you've got a tiger or something, okay?

{{< youtube caption="Listening to this makes me legitimately nervous."
            video_id="fxvGHQHiY70" align="right" >}}

In music, the same things can happen. You start off by trying to break the traditional formula, tweak the "usual" sounds, and somehow end up making something that sounds less like a song and more like a lightly-choreographed physical assault.

Is it art? Absolutely.

Is it music? Depends on who you ask.

Does it inspire a sense of wonder? For me, no: I can't follow what's going on, so it confuses me; I don't find the sound pleasing, so it irritates me.

### Baby Bear Magic: enough to inspire wonder, tempered with familiarity.
