For the last two years, [Marisa](https://marisamorby.com) and I have been living outside the United States, staying exclusively in Airbnbs. In strangers' homes.

When we first set off on our [grand travel and remote work experiment]({{< ref "remote-work-travel.md" >}}), we had several hypotheses about how things would go. Here's a quick recap of what we expected:

1. **We don't have to wait until we retire to start traveling.**
2. **It's possible to be productive during sustained periods of travel.**
3. **It's just as cheap (or cheaper) to live abroad.**
4. **It's healthier to live abroad than it is to live in the United States.**
5. **Living abroad for extended periods of time means _huge_ tax breaks.**

## Two Years In: Were My Hypotheses Correct?

When I [boarded a one-way flight to Milan]({{< ref "leaving.md" >}}) at the end of 2014, I had no idea whether or not I was right about _any_ of these hypotheses. Sure, I had my gut feelings and I'd done my research, but without putting it into practice, I was still making educated guesses at best.

{{% tweetable url="https://lengstorf.com/two-years-in-airbnbs/" via="jlengstorf" %}}Knowing a thing and actually doing a thing are two very different things.{{% /tweetable %}}

Now it's been two years, and I've been testing these hypotheses the whole time. So... was I right? 

### 1. Is it possible to travel extensively before retirement?

**tl;dr:** _Abso-fucking-lutely._

There are only two prerequisites for long-term travel:

1. a willingness to spend an extended period of time exploring the world, and
2. a stable source of income that never (or rarely) requires physical presence

If you _don't_ have a location-independent source of income, it's easy to throw your hands up and say, "Well, that works for programmers, but not for [INSERT PROFESSION HERE] like me."

**Bullshit.**[^probably]

[^probably]:
    Hold your fucking horses before you jump down my throat here — I'm getting to the fine print. Don't begrudge a guy his flair for the dramatic, okay?

    While there are obvious exceptions — hard skills like carpentry and transmission repair don't travel well — a huge number of jobs in the western world have moved online.

    In my travels I've met trademark lawyers, stock brokers, accountants, journalists, customer service reps, marriage counselors, and real estate consultants; if your job is performed on a computer, it's _extremely_ plausible that [you can become a remote worker]({{< ref "how-to-become-location-independent.md" >}}).

However, there is a caveat to all this: **you need to have your network in place _first_.**

When I left, I had already been in my industry for a decade, and I have an amazing group of previous clients who have always sent interesting opportunities my way. I've also put a fair amount of time into meeting other people in my industry and building a professional network.

My network meant I could rely on my [sales pipeline staying full]({{< ref "how-to-sell-without-selling.md" >}}) when my existing contracts wrapped up. It meant I had people who could send me leads if I needed work. Most of all, it meant my income was _stable_.

#### Freelancers: you need a network first.

Marisa, however, had just switched industries when we left. She realized that most of what she'd been doing in her role as a human resources director crossed over with user experience, and she was _way_ more interested in working in user experience.

When we started traveling, she was trying to _build_ her network. **It's not impossible to create a network while traveling — she pulled it off — but it _is_ way more difficult.** There were a few tough months where she didn't have anything in her pipeline and wasn't sure where her next contract would come from. There were times she felt hopeless because no one was responding to her cold emails. There were a crying jags in the bathtub. And since we were in Japan or wherever, she couldn't just roll down the street to a business meetup and use her trademark combination of giant sexy brain + irresistible curly cuteness to win people over in-person.

So if you aren't already established with a network, **spend time building your network first**: go to meetups, attend conferences, meet people, and create a solid pipeline. It may take a year, but when you're in Thailand and your current contract ends, a network means the difference between dropping a few lines to let people convince you why you should work with them, and trying to decide exactly how close you're willing to get to broke before you pull the rip-cord and head home.

### 2. Is it hard to stay productive while traveling constantly?

I closed my eyes and let the _déjà vu_ wash over me. I was having _this_ conversation. Again.

"I'd never get _anything_ done," she said with a self-deprecating chuckle. "I'd be too distracted by the sand and the ocean."

In an alternate reality where my filter is all the way broken,[^filter] I clunk my beer down and turn to face her. "Listen," I snap, "if all it takes to keep you from getting your shit taken care of is a beach, then I'd say the beach is the least of your fucking problems."

[^filter]:
    In _this_ reality, my filter is only mostly broken.

But I'm a coward, so instead I just nod and smile and look for a way to politely exit the conversation.

Here's the thing: **staying productive on the road is _easy_.** Once you [get your productivity habits sorted]({{< ref "productivity-habits.md" >}}), hitting "office-standard" productivity goals for an eight-hour day takes _at most_ six hours. Probably four.[^time]

[^time]:
    The industry's dirty little secret is that [working longer hours makes us less productive]({{< ref "overtime-hurts-productivity.md" >}}), and the constant distractions in an office add up to [huge amounts of wasted time while working]({{< ref "scheduling-maximum-productivity.md" >}}).

**For the last two years I've averaged roughly 37 hours a week on a computer — that's _including_ Netflix time – and my productivity sits at 75%[^email] overall.**

[^email]:
    I categorize email, chat, and all meetings as unproductive time. That accounts for an additional 10% of my screen time in 2016.

#### However, productivity goes to hell if you travel too fast.

A few times over the last couple years we decided to make "quick trips". A long weekend in Berlin; a couple days in Budapest; five days in Istanbul. Had we looked at these trips as vacations, things would have been fine. But we didn't — we thought we'd be able to get things done on these short trips.

Fast travel makes productivity _hard_. If you're in a place for a few months, there's time for both work and seeing the city. But **when your time is restricted, you have to start making choices between a thing you want to do in the city and a thing you need to do for work — and work typically loses.**

Everyone will have a different [Goldilocks Zone]({{< ref "goldilocks-zone.md" >}}) for balancing experience, productivity, and exploration,[^goldilocks-zone] but it's important not to get antsy and try to see everything in a hurry. Working and traveling is a way to _avoid_ high-stress, high-speed vacations; don't forget to take advantage of that freedom to maximize both your productivity _and_ [your level of satisfaction]({{< ref "baseline.md" >}}) about traveling.

[^goldilocks-zone]:
    For me, the Goldilocks Zone is about two months. If I stay longer, I start to feel listless and catch myself settling into the kinds of routines that spurred me to leave in the first place.
    
    A month can work, but I usually feel like I've just started to make friends and know the neighborhood at that point. For the last year Marisa and I have aimed for about 6–8 weeks in a location, and we've been happy with that result.

### 3. How much does it actually cost to travel the world for two years?

When I left the United States in 2014, my only experience of traveling abroad was a short trip with [Nate]({{< ref "best-friends.md" >}}) to Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK.

That trip nearly bankrupted me.

Over the course of ten days or so, I managed to spend every penny I had (and quite a few that I didn't). After Nate left a couple days early for a work thing[^borrow] I was forced to ration food for the last 36 hours because I'd maxed out all my credit cards and only had about €8 or so to my name.

[^borrow]:
    Which meant I couldn't borrow any additional money from him.

My experience isn't uncommon. My dad always grumbles about travel because it costs too much. Friends are always putting off vacations because they can't afford them.

So naturally, most of us — myself included until mid-2015 or so — immediately assume that long-term travel will be _expensive_. Prohibitively so.

But that's simply not the case. For most people living in the United States, [long-term travel is significantly cheaper than our current living costs]({{< ref "cost-of-living.md" >}}).

#### My cost-of-living for 2016–2017: $54.80/day

For the last two years, I've averaged $1,666.88 per month to live. And that's not just rent; that's rent _plus_ utilities _plus_ cable and internet _plus_ electric _plus_ property taxes or hotel taxes or whatever taxes.

In that time, I've lived in a dozen or so different countries, ranging from oceanside resorts in Koh Samui (~$22/day) to a courtyard apartment in Rome (~$79/day) to a kitschy apartment in the heart of Zagreb (~$34/day).

For reference, my cost of living in Portland was ~$88/day.[^portland]

[^portland]:
    My rent was on the higher side in Portland at $1,950/month — I was happy to pay a little more for a nice place in a great location. However, it's worth noting that most of the Airbnbs we were renting for less were just as nice (and in some cases nicer) than my Belmont loft in Portland.

#### It's also cheaper to eat (and do other stuff, too).

Beyond just the cost of rent and utilities and other living expenses, we also saved a _ton_ on food. Most of my disposable income goes toward eating well, so this was not an insignificant savings.

For example, in Vietnam we regularly ate banh mi sandwiches that would cost about $10 in the United States for less than VND 25,000 — which is roughly a U.S. dollar. A _fancy_ meal — a multi-course affair for two — would cost _maybe_ $20. **Most of the time Marisa and I both ate for less than $5 total.**

Thailand was astonishingly cheap as well.[^thai-food] Ditto Croatia.[^split]

[^thai-food]:
    One of our favorite meals was marinated pork grilled in the back of a truck. It cost 50 baht (USD $1.41). When we felt like eating a Western breakfast, we went to the "expensive" brunch place — a restaurant that could have been plucked off any hipster street in a U.S. city called Rustic & Blue — and paid 200 baht (USD $5.65) for eggs Benedict or a breakfast sandwich that held up to many restaurants at home.

[^split]:
    In Split, Croatia, Marisa and I sat down to a five-course meal at one of the most expensive restaurants in the city. We ordered two drinks each. Including a fairly large tip — especially considering the European standard is 10% — the whole meal cost USD $125. (That's not exactly cheap, but for comparison, a meal of this quality in the U.S. would _easily_ run $400+.)
    
    Most meals in Croatia were closer to 25 kuna (USD $3.58).

The food wasn't an anomaly, either. Our gym memberships, mobile phone service, and other day-to-day expenses all went down. The United States is _expensive_, you guys.

#### Plus you can't buy new shit.

Probably the biggest impact on my spending was the fact that I couldn't store anything. If I bought something, I either had to pack it every couple months or leave it behind when we moved.

So my impulse purchasing dropped to near-zero. 

### 4. Is it actually healthier to live outside the United States?

Yep. I lost 20 pounds. The only changes?

1. I averaged about 7,500 steps a day in 2016, according to the Apple Health app. This is not a lot of walking, honestly, but it's a _lot more_ than I was doing before I started traveling.
2. I ate local food. Not _healthy_ local food; just whatever the locals ate. As a result I ate a shitload more vegetables, a lot less bread, and almost nothing processed.

Portion sizes were notably smaller. Our typical approach to a restaurant was to order three entrees: Marisa would eat all of one and a few bites of the second, and I'd eat the rest.[^vegas]

[^vegas]:
    I spoke at a conference in Las Vegas in 2015, after we'd picked up the three-entree habit, and ordered three entrees in a diner — an egg dish each, with pancakes to share — and the waitress couldn't fit our order on the table.
    
    I'd never really thought about portion sizes in the U.S. being all that big, but **you guys they're fucking huge.**

I had already been going to they gym three times a week, and no doubt that played a significant role, but there was a _notable_ increase in weight loss when I got away from the North American diet I was used to.

Also, Marisa got even hotter.

### 5. Are the tax breaks for long-term travelers real? And how much is actually saved?

TKTK

Yep. 25% on gross income stayed in my pocket. The IRS still has time to audit me, but my returns were all accepted without complaint, and I was able to hold onto a significant portion of my income.
