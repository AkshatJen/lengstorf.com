For the last two years, [Marisa](https://marisamorby.com) and I have been living outside the United States, staying exclusively in Airbnbs. In strangers' homes.

When we first set off on our [grand travel and remote work experiment]({{< ref "remote-work-travel.md" >}}), we had several hypotheses about how things would go. Here's a quick recap of what we expected:

1. We don't have to wait until we retire to start traveling.
2. It's possible to be productive during sustained periods of travel.
3. It's just as cheap (or cheaper) to live abroad.
4. It's healthier to live abroad than it is to live in the United States.
5. Living abroad for extended periods of time means _big_ tax breaks.

## Two Years In: Were My Hypotheses Correct?

TKTK

### 1. Is it possible to travel extensively before retirement?

TKTK

Yes, but you need to have a network and income stream _first_. I was fine; Marisa struggled a little because she was trying to break into a new industry.

### 2. Is it hard to stay productive while traveling constantly?

TKTK

Nope. Unless you travel too fast.

### 3. How much does it actually cost to travel the world for two years?

TKTK

Nowhere near as much as we expected. Average monthly cost — and listen, we fucking _balled hard_ — was USD $1,666.88.

### 4. Is it actually healthier to live outside the United States?

TKTK

Yep. I lost 20 pounds. The only changes?

1. I averaged about 7,500 steps a day in 2016, according to the Apple Health app. I can't seem to find a way to check my 2015 averages, but I'd bet they're about the same. This is not a lot of walking, honestly, but it's a lot more than I was doing before I started traveling.
2. I ate local food. Not _healthy_ local food; just whatever the locals ate. As a result I ate a shitload more vegetables, a lot less bread, and almost nothing was processed.

I had already been going to they gym three times a week, and no doubt that played a significant role, but there was a _notable_ increase in weight loss when I got away from the North American diet I was used to.

Also, Marisa got even hotter.

### 5. Are the tax breaks for long-term travelers real? And how much is actually saved?

TKTK

Yep. 25% on gross income stayed in my pocket. The IRS still has time to audit me, but my returns were all accepted without complaint, and I was able to hold onto a significant portion of my income.
