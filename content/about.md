## Why I Created This Website

In 2013, I had everything I thought I wanted — a profitable business with great employees, high-profile clients like Intel and PlayStation, an incredible apartment full of designer furniture — but I still wasn't happy.

I was working insane hours, I never saw my friends and family, and my health was deteriorating.

I felt cheated. The questions kept bouncing around in my head:

> What went wrong? I did everything I thought I was supposed to do to be successful.

After way too long in the [Overkill Cult][1], I realized that I had traded one prison (working minimum-wage jobs with no room for advancement) for another, less obvious prison: I had traded *everything* for the promise of success, but I hadn't asked what "success" really meant.

In 2014, I finally asked myself the question I should have started with:

> "What does success mean to me?"

When I realized what I actually wanted out of life, I drastically reduced the number of hours I worked — without sacrificing my productivity — sold off all of my possessions, and [bought a one-way ticket out of the United States][2].

  Acting like a cool guy in Barcelona.

I've been on the road ever since. And now? I work a manageable 40 hours each week; I explore a new city every month or so; I spend more time than ever with loved ones; I've lost 30 lbs.

**I'm happier than I've ever been.**

But here's the thing: I don't think what I did was extraordinary. In fact, I think *anyone* can find the same happiness. *Starting today.*

I started this website to show anyone who's ever felt like I used to feel that there's a better way, and it doesn't take anything but a will to change.

And, look: I'm not selling anything. I don't have a product to sell you. I just wish someone would have told me this stuff before I spent a decade killing myself at a keyboard.

I've put together a guide to show you how to get your hours under control, how to start working remotely, and — ultimately — how to travel the world for less than it costs to rent an apartment in the US.
