The free guide you requested is on its way.

And as I continue to experiment with creating a happier, more balanced, more meaningful life for myself, I'll share the things I think might help make your life better, too.

## What to Do Now

### 1. Check your email for the free guide.

You should see an email with a link to download the guide within the next few minutes. Download the PDF and give it a read.

### 2. See what makes me tick, and why I write this blog.

[Read this page]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) and learn why I write, what I'm hoping to accomplish, and what I look like with a mustache.

### 3. Connect with me on your favorite social channels.

I make bad jokes and share links to other things that made me think on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jlengstorf) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), post photos of my travels and (only some of) my meals on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jlengstorf), and I'm doing a terrible job of learning how [Snapchat](/images/jlengstorf-snapcode.png) works.

Thanks again,
