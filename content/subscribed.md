I'm so excited to be a part of your transformation from a desk jockey to a world traveler.

You should receive the first part of the *Earn from Anywhere* course within the next few minutes. If you don't see the message, it may have ended up in your Spam folder (or in your Promotions folder in Gmail).

You can add <jason@lengstorf.com> to your address book to try and prevent that from happening if you'd like. (In Gmail you can drag the lesson from your Promotions tab to your Inbox and Gmail should remember to put the rest of the messages there.)

I'm really happy you're here. I can't wait to see what you're able to accomplish.

Now — if I can ask for more stuff — it would be awesome if you [liked my page on Facebook][1] and [followed me on Twitter][2].

You're awesome. Thanks for brightening my day a little.
