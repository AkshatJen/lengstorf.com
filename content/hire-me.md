## Hire Me for Speaking, Coaching, Web Consulting, Workshops, Training, and More

My favorite place to be is up against a new challenge. I get to dig into research, create ideas, and test those ideas against real scenarios.

**And that's what I'd like to do for you: solve hard problems.**

{{< credibility >}}

I can do that in a few ways:

## Speaking

I've spoken at large conferences, such as ForwardJS and CSS Dev Conf, and I've spoken to small meetup groups, such as PHP Sevilla and Montana Programmers.

No matter what size your event or your company, I'm happy to share what I've learned with your group — whether that's on work-life balance, productivity, remote work, the business of freelance, or on something more technical.[^code]

[^code]:
    For technical speaking — things like code and design and build tools and such — check out the nerdy arm of my site at [code.lengstorf.com](https://code.lengstorf.com/hire-me/)

I'm available for both on-site and remote speaking; just [let me know where and when](mailto:jason@lengstorf.com?subject=Speaking Inquiry&body=Is this for an event or a company?%0D%0AWhat date(s) would you need more for?%0D%0AWhere is this happening? And would you want me on-site or remote?%0D%0AWhat would you like me to speak about?%0D%0AWhat's your budget?%0D%0A) so we can see if our schedules line up.

## Workshops

There's no better way to make sure information sinks in than to _actually do the thing you're trying to learn_. Reading or listening to new information is helpful, but if we're only _reading_ and not _applying_ that knowledge, it doesn't do any good.

I can create a workshop to not only introduce new concepts, but actually walk you, your team, and/or your event's attendees through _using_ the new information. This'll ensure it sinks in, catch any implementation questions early, and get the hard part — actually starting — out of the way with guidance from someone who's been there.

These can be done on-site or remote. [Send me details to get started.](mailto:jason@lengstorf.com?subject=Workshop Inquiry&body=Is this for an event or a company?%0D%0AWhat date(s) would you need more for?%0D%0AWhere is this happening? And would you want me on-site or remote?%0D%0AWhat would you like me to speak about?%0D%0AWhat's your budget?)

## 1-on-1 Coaching

I take a very small number of private coaching clients, with whom I work on areas ranging from creating a better work-life balance to launching businesses to establishing killer productivity rituals and habits.

We'll get on a bi-weekly video call (or meet in person if we're in the same place) to discuss where you're at, where you want to go, and how to get there using concrete, actionable steps.

I'll offer insight, help create the plans, work with you to make the plan actionable, and create accountability to keep you on track.

If you're interested, [let me know what you want to get out of coaching](mailto:jason@lengstorf.com?subject=Coaching Inquiry&body=Tell me a little about yourself, where you are in life, and why you're interested in hiring a coach right now.).

## One-Off Questions

If you've got one or two questions, but they're maybe too in-depth or personal to ask over social media, I use a platform called [Clarity](https://clarity.fm/jlengstorf) to offer pay-by-the-minute coaching calls.

This is ideal if you don't need a coach, but you'd like a second opinion on something you're working through right now. It's also a good way to get a feel for whether or not you and I make a good match for coaching.

To get started, [book a call with me on Clarity](https://clarity.fm/jlengstorf).
