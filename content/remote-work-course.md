## Everything You Need to Go Location-Independent

The *Earn from Anywhere* guide is broken up into several key areas you'll need to address before you leave the country:

*   The lies about work that we've grown up believing
*   What's possible once we discard the Overkill Cult's dogma
*   How to become truly location-independent
*   What we need to do before we leave
*   How to survive once we're on the road
*   Ideas for staying happy and productive in our travels
*   Strategies for US citizens to save big on taxes
*   And much more

The guide is broken up to lessons, which are delivered over a few days to make them easy to remember and simple to implement. By the end of the course you'll have everything you need to break free of your anchors and see the world now — without sacrificing your comfort or security later.

When you're ready to take the first step toward a life of travel and adventure, just enter your email below to get the first lesson delivered instantly.

### Why did I go to the trouble of putting this guide together just to give it away for free?

That's a fair question, and I have a few reasons:

1.  I put this guide together for myself when I initially left the United States to start traveling permanently.
2.  The location-independent lifestyle has been one of the more rewarding experiences of my life, and I believe this holds true for anyone who cares to try it.
3.  I get a huge amount of satisfaction from helping others become the best versions of themselves; that's why I teach, speak, and write.

So don't worry: this guide is free, and **the only payment I want in return is your success.** And maybe you'll share some of my articles if they help you.

If you don't like it, you can unsubscribe at any time and/or reply to a message to let me know how I can improve it.

You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
