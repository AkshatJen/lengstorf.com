Are you interested in picking my brain about remote working or productivity? Want me to be be a part of your next event or article?

I'd love to help you out!

There are three ways to get in touch with me:

## 1\. Schedule a Call with Me

<style>
  #clarity-widget { display: none; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 20px; } @media (min-width: 768px) { #clarity-widget { display: block; }
</style>

<div id="clarity-widget">
  <iframe class="clarity-widget" data-c-id="67162" data-c-width="" frameborder="0"></iframe> <script src="https://clarity.fm/assets/widget_loader.js"></script>
</div>

I'm available for [calls on Clarity.fm][1].

If you have a question about your business, your career, or your lifestyle that I won't be able to answer in a couple sentences, this is probably the best option.

We can talk about your business, your productivity, or your career â€” or anything else that's on your mind.<br style="clear:both;" />

## 2\. Ask on Social Media

I'm more responsive on social media than I am on email. If you've got a quick question, or something urgent, drop me a line on [Facebook][2] or [Twitter][3] and you'll hear back from me quickly.[^email]

## 3\. Send Me a Message

If you want to talk about something that doesn't make sense on social media, you can <a href='mail&#116;o&#58;j%61%&#55;3&#37;6Fn&#64;l&#37;6&#53;ng&#37;7&#51;%&#55;4&#37;&#54;Fr%66&#46;c%6Fm'>email me directly</a>. Please keep in mind that I check email infrequently, so it may take me a few days to get back to you.


[^email]:
    In comparison to email, at least. As in a response within hours instead of days.
