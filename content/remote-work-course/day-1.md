Let's cut straight to the chase: **the way most people are working today is killing them.**

The workplace today has completely lost sight of long-term sustainability. Companies ignore long-term health issues, turnover problems, and job satisfaction for the sake of grinding a few extra productive minutes from the workforce.

"We can't focus on employee wellbeing right now," say the decision-makers, "because we're under pressure from the shareholders to get the numbers up this quarter."

So the drudgery continues and, ironically, companies' revenues suffer nearly as much as the employees killing themselves for the cause.

In this way, many companies today are sitting in fertile fields, leaning against a bag of seed, hacking chunks off their legs to eat rather than sowing. Quick fixes to short-term problems — at the expense of long-term viability — trump common sense with alarming frequency.

Most disturbingly, this happens so frequently that it all just feels... normal.

We feel like it's just the way things are, and that we don't really have a choice in the matter.

The first step toward starting a life free to do what you want is to recognize **many things we think are mandatory are actually *entirely optional*.**

Worse, a lot of things we're told are normal and necessary are actually *horrible* for us.

In today's lesson, let's talk about how terribly broken the current working environment is, and what we need to do if we hope to fix the problem.

## The Modern Workplace Has Become a Cult

> The Overkill Cult is a cultural delusion that working 60+ hours each week — at the expense of everything else in our lives — is not only a necessary part of success, but that doing so is somehow honorable.

**We're part of the first generation that's grown up on the "do what you love" ethos.** We've been told we can be anything we want, and as a result many of us ended up in jobs that were exciting and challenging — at least at first.

Unfortunately, our ambition, passion, and dedication to these jobs we love has led to an unhealthy, one-sided relationship with work. We give our jobs *everything,* and we receive less and less in return.

This cult of work has crept into the very core of modern business, and now **our value at work is determined less by what we do than it is by how long we do it.**

The long hours, late nights, and lack of sleep have been painted up as badges of honor. But they're exactly the opposite: they signify a lack of control; a misunderstanding of how our best work is produced; a severe imbalance in our priorities.

Fortunately, *it's not too late to make a change.*

The Overkill Cult is a lie. You can leave whenever you want.

Just don't let it kill you first.

## The Traditional View of Productivity Is Wrong

Thanks to the unhealthy working patterns set up by the Overkill Cult, many companies look at productivity as a strictly linear relationship: more time working means more production.

But we all know — even if we don't admit it — that **productivity is a limited resource.** We can only do so much in a day before our brain fatigues and we can't put thoughts together effectively.

We need to recognize three fundamental truths — proven by research over and over again — if we're going to succeed in both work and, you know, remaining alive.

### 1\. Working Longer Hours Does Not Make Us More Productive

We try to convince ourselves that we can work at full speed forever, but the reality is that it doesn't take long before our ["crunch time" productivity is lower][2] than it would be if we'd just worked a sane schedule.

We have to recognize that working a regular schedule isn't just about free time; it's about doing higher-quality work.

And refusing to work those long hours isn't just good for you — it's good for the business. After even short periods of time — as little as a month — **a 60+ hour work week results in *less* getting done than if we'd worked for 40 hours a week** during that same time period.

It's counterintuitive, but it's true for both [manual labor][3] and [knowledge work][4].

**Further reading: [Overtime: How to Lose Employees and Kill Your Business][5]**

### 2\. Our Worth as Employees Should Be Measured by Results, Not Minutes

Knowledge workers, by name, are hired for what they *know.* We're hired to solve problems and produce results.

But, **for reasons that defy common sense and a century's worth of research, many companies only measure the worth of their team by the number of hours worked.**

This is *exactly the opposite* of the ideal approach.

Let's take an oversimplified example: a large company has two department heads that need to create a quarterly report. Both reports require the same amount of work to create.

One of these two people works hard and efficiently to complete the report in a day and a half (about 12 hours of logged time at work).

The other slacks off and takes a full week (about 40 hours logged).

Both employees make the same salary of $50,000/year, or about $25/hour (based on a 40-hour work week). So the efficient employee was paid $300 to complete this report, and the slower employee was paid $1,000.

To top that off, the more efficient employee was probably handed extra work to fill up the time — you know, to "justify the salary".

Measuring based on time rewards inefficiency and punishes efficiency.

*It's time to start measuring results instead of attendance.*

### 3\. When We're Not at Work, We Shouldn't Be at Work

Did you know that [half of all work email is handled outside of working hours (PDF)][6]? Or that over a quarter of all work is done during the time we're not supposed to be working?

Email, and later smartphones, changed the way we communicate. In 1970, your boss would have to get in his car and drive to your house if he wanted to ask you a work question. Now he can ruin your family dinner from his couch at home — if you let him.

**There's a difference between being a team player and being an enabler.** If your team isn't able to pull their shit together during working hours, you shouldn't be the one who suffers as a result. Let them figure it out on their own, or answer first thing when you get to work the next morning.

Taking time away from work is not a selfish, I-don't-want-to-work endeavor, either; [leisure time is good for your career](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237446).

Beyond that, the subconscious mind is an incredible thing — if we let it work. If you've ever had one of those *holy shit* moments while in the shower, drifting off to sleep, or playing a game, that's your subconscious at work.

Whether it's actually working in the office, or simply checking work emails at all hours, **if we stay engaged with work at all times, we don't give ourselves enough distance from work to let our subconscious do its magic.**

So take a break. For your health *and* for your career.

## How to Fix the Modern Workplace

Here's where we are: we know that **we're living in a culture that encourages workaholism, counts minutes instead of results, and pressures us to be "always on" — even when we're not at work.**

How, then, can we go about fixing it?

There are a lot of ways to go about it, but here are three that I know

### 1. Get Serious About Protecting Your Time

If you work in an office or another setting where people ask you for things constantly — meetings, input, help on projects, etc. — you'll need to *kinda-sorta* act like a total dick if you want to protect your time.

That doesn't mean you need to be rude or unpleasant. It means **you have to be selective about what kind of work you take on.**

Do you need to be on that meeting, or can you just read the notes afterward?

Will your input on that project *actually* make it better, or does the project lead have it under control?

Is this new project going to make a big difference? Are *you* the person who will make that big difference? And is this the big difference that you *want* to make?

Start saying no unless a meeting or project meets strict guidelines. That way you can **put your focus into big-impact projects and avoid the busywork and distractions.** By doing that, you can focus on long-term gains and big accomplishments rather than getting stuck in the merry-go-round of short-term hustles and wasted time.

At first, people might think you're being difficult. But your results will speak for themselves. And really, most people ask for meetings and help as a way of procrastinating or avoiding responsibility — don't enable that shit.

If you want a much more detailed read on how to put this into practice, read [*Essentialism*](http://amzn.to/1KB7qTO) by Greg McKeown.

### 2. Go Remote

If you're able to get out of the office entirely, it gets much easier to avoid a lot of the daily distractions that steal our focus and result in less effective work — and longer hours.

With a remote working setup, results-based work is more or less non-negotiable. That means **you get to control your time as long as you make sure the items on your todo list are done.**

Plus, being a remote worker doesn't mean *never* going to the office. Sometimes it's nice to spend a day at the office to catch up with coworkers, have important meetings, or just to remind people that you're not dead. **Being remote means you have a *choice* about going to the office, rather than being stuck in a cubicle no matter how hard it is to get things done.**

This is my favorite option, but it's also not always easy.

However, if you can [convince your manager to let you work remotely](http://lengstorf.com/convince-your-boss-remote-work/), you regain control of your time and establish a results-based working style.

### 3. Quit Your Job

If your job is killing you and doesn't want to change, take your show on the road. It takes drive and a willingness to take risks, but the reward is worth it.

**There are dozens of options for working remotely**, ranging from highly-skilled positions (computer programming, accounting, etc.) to no-experience-required positions (customer service, transcription, etc.).

Over the last few years, the world has fundamentally changed, work-wise: nearly every job that doesn't directly require physical presence — e.g. food service, construction — can be done remotely thanks to technology like video calls, collaborative documents (e.g. Google Docs and [Draft](https://draftin.com)), and other apps and tools that allow us to mimic in-person interactions with very little difference.

## Remember: You Might Not Live to See "Later"

Most of the unhealthy, obsessive working style of the Overkill Cult is based on the idea of working hard *now* for a better life *later*. But when, exactly, is "later"?

**The traditional concept of retirement is rapidly evaporating.** It's becoming [harder to quit working in your mid-60s](http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2012/10/23/more-americans-say-80-is-the-new-retirement-age/) and start tackling that ever-growing bucket list.

Besides, some of that stuff you want to do just isn't possible (or fun) as a senior citizen.[^old]

[^old]: I mean, maybe *you'll* be the kind of Golden Ager who rides motorcycles across the U.S. or scuba dives off the coast of Thailand, but I think that would make you the exception to the rule.

**It's a cliché, but nothing is guaranteed except right now.** Despite what gets hammered into our heads by education and office culture, we don't have to put off the things we want to do until "later".

People dream of all the things they'll do once they retire: see the world, spend more time with their families, relax.

They dream, and then they put it off for "later" — some distant future that may not ever arrive.

But here's the kicker: **you that you can live out your big future plans right now.** And you can keep earning a living while you do it.

We need to start living now. "Later" may never arrive.

## What Happens Next

**Today, we talked about some of the things that are wrong with the modern workplace, and what needs to change.** Whether that means working within your organization to affect company-wide change, or something simpler — changing your freelance practices or getting just your team at work to fix bad habits — or even something more extreme, like quitting and striking out on your own as a freelancer (or applying for new, remote-based jobs), we need to make the effort if we want to have a healthy relationship with our careers.

**Tomorrow, we'll dig into how we can make changes to the way we work** — whether we're on a team of 500 or working alone — that will help us become more effective, because when we get things done more effectively, we have more bargaining power as employees (or freelancers) to control our time, income, stress levels, and overall freedom.
