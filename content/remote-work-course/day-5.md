Today's the last day of the course.

We've talked about the theory: the [modern workplace is eating its own tail]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-1.md" >}}); most of us have [horrible, self-destructive working habits]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-2.md" >}}); our literal and figurative [closets could do with some cleaning]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-3.md" >}}).

We've talked about the [practical steps]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-4.md" >}}): get the gear, book smart, be prepared, cover your ass.

What's left to cover?

Today, we're going to stick with the pattern of boring-on-the-surface-but-critically-important ideas. You've probably seen this one on an inspirational Instagram post, and it probably barely registered — because, like most universal wisdom, it's had its teeth knocked out after decades of abuse by well-meaning business coaches and yoga teachers.

So please suspend your eye rolling and internal groaning until we get at least a paragraph or two into the *why* behind this one.

All the plans, theories, and research in the world are worth nothing unless you take the first step.

## Don't Get Caught in the Theoretical Weeds

We all know someone who packs a lot of excuses.

"I could totally do that if it wasn't for my job."

"I'd be there in a second if I wasn't so busy."

"If I was five years younger I'd be all over this."

We're not listening to this person and thinking, "You know, you *could* totally play in the NFL if your parents hadn't taken you out of Baby Bashers league as a kid."[^dunk]

[^dunk]:
    I've been this guy. In high school, during a game of *NBA Jam* (that I was losing), I confidently remarked to my friends, "You know, if we could dunk, we could absolutely play in the NBA."

We're thinking, "Christ, will you *shut up*? Nobody cares about all your dead dreams."

## Too Much Preparation Is Procrastination

As a kid, I used to plot elaborate scenarios for my toys. I had a couple hundred Matchbox cars, and I'd spend hours taking them out, thinking up a story line, and placing them in exactly the right position.

Usually, by the time I was finished, my friends had left because it was so boring, I'd lost interest in actually playing, and it was time for me to clean up my toys and go to dinner.

My perfect scenario had become such a burden to prepare for that it never actually came to be. It faded as a near-completed project that was abandoned due to the deadly combination of lost passion and Mom's White People Enchiladas™.[^mwpe]

[^mwpe]:
    3 frozen chicken breasts, cooked and cubed<br>4 large flour tortillas<br>1 can cream of mushroom soup<br>2 cups Monterey Jack cheese<br><br>Roll chicken and cheese inside the tortillas and place in a baking pan. Cover the whole thing in cream of mushroom soup, and top with the remaining cheese. Bake until it's bubbly.<br><br>Mom's White People Enchiladas™ — for the "adventurous eater" scared to eat anything new.

As an adult, I find myself using this "get it all perfect" approach when I want to avoid actually *doing* whatever it is I'm planning for.

You will *never* feel 100% prepared. Everything new I've ever tried has been terrifying the first time, regardless of how much preparation I've done beforehand.

So don't put off your plans until you feel "ready" — you can only feel ready once you've proven you can do it. And the only way to prove that is to do it.

## Practical Experience Is Not Optional

We've just spent several days covering a huge amount of information. You may feel overwhelmed.

But don't let that hold you back. This is a big skill to learn, and it's a skill that requires hands-on practice before it feels comfortable.

Imagine tight-rope walking. (And, for the purposes of this analogy, let's assume I know how to walk on a tight-rope.)

I can write hundreds of thousands of words about tight-rope walking, detailing dozens of strategies, techniques, and tips. I could wring every ounce of expertise out of myself in perfectly accessible language for aspiring tight-rope walkers.

And you could ready everything I wrote and learn every word by heart. You could watch my performances and study them obsessively. You could become the foremost scholar on my tight-rope walking technique.

But in the end, you still wouldn't be able to get on a tight-rope and walk.

To do that, you have to stand up on the rope, feel your balance, notice the way your feet feel when you're stable, learn to anticipate the way your body will move as your balance shifts.

You actually have to *do* the thing you want to learn.

If you want to learn a language, you have to speak it — even though you'll sound ridiculous the first time you try.

If you want to become a surfer, you have to fall a few times before you understand how the board catches a wave.

And if you want to travel the world, you have to *leave* — even though you don't know exactly what's out there waiting for you.

### Fear Is a Friend

In the general sense, fear is an unnecessary emotion. It's supposed to signal danger, and — let's be honest — aside from the odd bad driver, there's just not that much *real* danger left in the world for humans in western society.

So fear has evolved. Instead of alerting us to danger, it's started alerting us to anxiety, which doesn't signal much more than our own lack of comfort and experience in a situation.

Remember the first time you tried to ride a bike? Or the first time you rode mass transit? What about the first time you drove a car with a manual transmission?[^manual]

[^manual]:
    If you can't drive a stick, did the thought of it just cause you to tense up a little? That's exactly what I'm talking about.

In each case, a new situation probably tripped all sorts of fear alarms, and your body made its best effort to curl into the fetal position and give up before even trying.

But we've got it wrong: anxiety isn't a signal of danger; anxiety is a byproduct of our own attempts to predict the future.

Humans have a unique ability in that we can *imagine* things. We can run hypothetical scenarios in our heads and come to hypothetical conclusions that will affect the rest of our hypothetical lives.

But our hypothetical engines are faulty at best, and self-destructive at worst. People are biased toward negativity: if we *can* imagine a bad outcome, we'll try to convince ourselves that it's the *only* outcome.

So when we look at a bike, or a subway platform, or a stick shift, we see head injuries, perverts in trenchcoats, and astronomical transmission repair bills.[^what-we-see]

[^what-we-see]:
    Actually, we probably don't. More likely, we don't actually examine the anxiety and just feel the tension as a premonition about our impending demise in some grisly, gearbox-related freak accident.

But if we trust ourselves to survive, we can push through the first experience. Then the second. By the third, it's not so sphincter-clenchingly terrifying. By the tenth, it's just another thing we do without a second thought.

Big experiences are no different: learning a new language, living in a new country, starting a new job, or even jumping out of airplanes — at first, it's horrible and terrifying and too big to even consider, but after gaining some experience, it's just another thing we do.

## Take Away Your Safety Nets

As a kid, I never seemed capable of holding on to money. My parents gave me my allowance, and it was gone the same day. On my birthday, I'd tear open all the cards and collect the money inside[^grandma] and figure out how to spend it *all* within the week.

[^grandma]:
    Each year I plotted ways to convince my elderly relatives that I was a decade at a time. "I'm sorry to be a stickler, Gam Gam, but it looks like this check for $12 is missing a zero."

But I didn't have to care. After all, I was a minor; my parents would go to jail if I starved to death. So I just whined to my mom until she slipped me $10.

This changed when I was 18. I had just dropped out of college, and moved back in with my parents. This, in my world, was a major defeat. I was on a quest to become a *bona fide* adult, and here I was in my parents' basement again, expecting my mother to wash and fold my laundry.

So I made a decision: I was going to become self-sufficient, no matter what. I told my parents that I wouldn't accept any money from them, and if I *did*, I wanted to pay it back — with interest — as a loan.[^dad]

[^dad]:
    My dad loved this idea, and set up a whole Excel sheet to calculate the compounding interest and late fees and everything. But he cut me a break on the interest rates, which I appreciated.

And that changed things for me. Suddenly I wasn't playing with a failsafe anymore. This was *my* money; if I did a shitty job managing it, I had to pay interest to bail myself out.

Almost overnight, I became pretty good with money. The absence of a safety net forced me to learn the skills I'd been avoiding.

The same thing happened when I became a freelancer: I'd been keeping my day job, fearful of what might happen if I couldn't land enough business as a freelancer. Then — my confidence buoyed by a three-month contract — I cut the cord. Within days, I'd landed more work; by the end of the month, I was earning more than I'd ever pulled in through my day job — and that trend has never reverted.

By taking away the safety net — the "just in case" option — I was forced to commit to the path I really wanted to be on. And in the absence of any other option, I made the necessary steps to succeed.

Entrepreneurs talk about a need to "be hungry" to succeed. I'm not so sure that's a metaphor; when your options are "make this work" or "choose between buying groceries and paying the bills", the extra motivation to make it happen is easy to find.

## Don't Discount the Wisdom of Our Elders

Every year or so, this story starts circulating on social media about [the regrets of the dying](http://bit.ly/1R1F4BV). And the regrets are heartbreaking:

1. I wish I'd lived a life more true to myself, instead of living the way others expected me to live.
2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
3. I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish I'd let myself be happier.

This course was born out of my efforts to avoid four of these five regrets: by taking a chance on something I really wanted for myself, I'm attempting to live a life true to what I want; to use work only as a means to achieve that lifestyle; to share what I'm learning and feeling as I go through this adventure; and to remind myself every day — whether I'm looking over a beautiful beach while I'm writing, or cooking breakfast with hot dogs because I couldn't find breakfast meat at the corner store — that I can't possibly imagine a life I'd rather be living right now.

You have dreams, and you have choices. You deserve to live a life you'll be proud to look back on. You deserve to [find happiness on your journey]({{< ref "blog/finding-happiness.md" >}}).

And the only person who gets to make the choice about what your life will look like in retrospect — what you'll remember on your own deathbed — is you.

You're [the hero and the author of your story]({{< ref "blog/stories.md" >}}). I hope this course can help you write a good one.

## What's Next?

Making the transition to a life of long-term travel is no small task, but I hope this course has shown that it's far from impossible.

The workforce has changed, and this lifestyle is not only possible now, but it's *more practical* for both workers and employers. The prevalent attitudes toward working longer hours are both bad for our health *and bad for our productivity*. Long-term travel is not only an immensely rewarding experience, it's *cheaper to live abroad than to rent an apartment in Montana*.

You can travel solo. You can travel with a partner, like I do. You can even travel with children.

All you have to do is give yourself permission to do it, and take the first step. And then the next.

See you on the road,<br>
