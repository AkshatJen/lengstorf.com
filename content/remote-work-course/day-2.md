Yesterday, we talked about the problems we face in the workplace that keep us from becoming location independent. Today we'll be talking about the challenges we face in ourselves that pose significant challenges to remote workers.

This lesson is so important that I can guaran-goddamn-*tee* that — if you take this to heart and make it a priority — your life will change.[^lifechange]

[^lifechange]:
    And I mean *real* life change. Not, like, "Yeah, I mean, my teeth are a *little* whiter . . . I guess."

But this lesson, like so many truly important life lessons, is going to sound like I'm spouting a bullshit cliché. You're going to roll your eyes.

Are you ready?

Today's lesson is: *Work smarter, not harder.*

...I *know,* right?

But before you unsubscribe, let me explain.

## I'm Fucking Terrible at Work

If we could watch a video of a day chosen at random from my life circa 2013, it'd feel like watching a hamster: nibbling at whatever food showed up at the door, climbing into the wheel and running toward something of — judging by the side-splitting effort, at least —  critical importance, then tottering off exhausted, dumbly blinking away the 16:9 afterimages burned into my retinas, taking slow laps from one corner of my cage to the other, finally collapsing and counting hamstersheep and sweating through stress-dreams about the wheel.[^hamster]

[^hamster]:
    And then waking up with a brilliant new idea for maximizing efficiency at wheel-spinning by putting the water bottle nozzle *inside* the wheel so I can keep running without stopping to hydrate, which I'm convinced will change everything, but implementation challenges lead to scrapping the last week's worth of running and creating a backlog that requires extending the current sprint to make up for lost time.

I started my day with email. I took calls through lunch. I worked until I was too tired to think anymore.

Working that hard felt necessary. My todo list wasn't getting any shorter.

This was my sacrifice, I thought, to keep a job I told myself I loved.

### I Was Horribly Unorganized

I may have been at a computer for 12 or more hours a day, but hardly any of those hours — half at best — could be called *productive* work.

I'd start on a project in my code editor, then lose focus when my phone showed a new email. I'd start a reply to that email and get pulled away mid-draft by a ping from the work chat. I'd be reminded in the work chat that a deadline was coming up fast, so I'd open my code editor — to realize that I already had a half-finished project in the code editor.

And then another email would arrive.

### I Wasn't Productive; I Was Busy

Somewhere in early 2014 I realized that there was a critical difference between "productive" and "busy".

I had been *busy* for years, but my total-time-to-productive-time ratio was embarrassingly low. For every hour I worked, I was lucky if 30 minutes was productive. There were days where I "worked" 12 hours and — when I finally collapsed at 3am — my only accomplishments were a handful of emails (plus many more half-finished drafts), a few lines of code (that I'd end up rewriting later, once I was able to actually focus and saw how poorly-considered they were), and an alarming number of inbox refreshes.

When I hit the wall — Full Metal Burnout, physical illness from stress, and a medium-bodied existential crisis[^existential] — I finally realized that **I needed to figure out a better way to work if I was going to continue loving this job** I so desperately tried to love every day.

[^existential]:
    Said crisis combining the tart, young strawberryish notes of impotent philosophical rage against the pseudo-capitalist complex ruining the world or whatever with the subtle, copper penny undertones of deep-black despair at the thought of dying and no one remembering anything we ever said or did or loved.<br><br>The resultant blend fared well in reviews by *The Monthly Camus* (89 points) and *L'Âge de Raison d'Être* (93 points; included in "2014's Top 10 Mental Spirals"), but came under fire as "picayune and self-indulgent" from *Søren's Quarterly* (no rating because what do ratings really even like *mean*, anyways?).

## The World's Most Boring Superpower

It started as a self-destructive experiment: I would cut myself off from clients and coworkers for set periods of time each day so I could get things done without interruptions. I would also stop working at a reasonable hour.

This plan came with an asterisk: **I expected to become less successful as a result of my drastically-reduced availability.**

I was ready for clients to fire me for being too unavailable. I was prepared for my team to quit because I didn't support them quickly enough.

I made peace with the risk. And anyways I was planning — should this experiment fail to improve my situation — to *just fucking quit it all.* I've always thought it might be fun to work as a bar-back, anyways.

And so, with a death threat leveled at my career, I kicked off my experiment with three goals:

1. I would doggedly guard my attention against interruptions.
2. I would finish the projects I started and stop leaving dozens of half-finished tasks.
3. I would take breaks — *real* breaks — from working to be a Real Boy.[^realboy]

[^realboy]:
    E.g. a boy who goes outside and talks to other humans and breathes fresh air and smiles in ways that don't involve colons or parentheses.

## Goal #1: Treat Attention as a Precious Resource

The first thing I had to come to terms with was that **I'm hired to solve problems, not to punch a clock.**

When a client sends me a check, they expect increased leads or a beautiful website or an easy-to-follow marketing plan. No one cares if I spend 20 minutes or 20 hours; they want *results.*

If I wasn't giving my clients' projects 100% of my attention, *I was failing at the job I'd been hired to do.* At best, I turned in something subpar because I created it while distracted; at worst, I missed the deadline altogether because I kept getting pulled away and never got it done.

I needed to take drastic (to me) measures to guard my attention.

### Kill All Notifications

At first, it was only phone calls. Then there was email. Text messaging.

And then the Attention Apocalypse: smartphones introduced push notifications.

My phone grew in power and influence until I was helpless to resist its buzz, thumbs twitching in Pavlovian anticipation when the screen lit up with critical information: somewhere — far away — someone has posted a blurry photo of ________ and wants to make sure I drop *everything* until I've seen it.

{{< caption src="/images/useless-notification.jpg"

            alt="turn off notifications on your phone"
            attr="Van Baird"
            attrlink="http://www.relationaleq.com/blog/how-to-build-relational-equity-twitter-part-2" >}}
    HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
{{< /caption >}}

So I tried something extreme: **I disabled notifications from everything but text messages and phone calls, and I started putting my phone into airplane mode whenever I started a working block.**[^workingblock]

[^workingblock]:
    A working block, for me, is usually 60–90 minutes of hardcore focus on whatever I'm working on. In between each block I take breaks, where I can quickly scan for text messages, missed calls, or even social media updates. (Though I prefer not to check the social media stuff on breaks.)

I foresaw bedlam, lost revenue, utter chaos.

I experienced productivity, lowered stress, happier clients.

And no one unfollowed me on Twitter. I think.

## Goal #2: Stay Focused Above All Else

**We're paid for our ability to do amazing things with our brains.** We can build mental models of complex ideas, summoning years of experience and research, combining the best features and avoiding the shortcomings of all the projects we've studied and produced. When we're working in our areas of expertise, our synapses put on a formidable pyrotechnic display, and each high-powered brain-splosion[^brain-splosion] propels the project toward earth-shattering success.

[^brain-splosion]:
    This is how I'll be referring to ideas henceforth.

Unless we're too distracted to actually get anything useful done.

### Understand the Costs of Multitasking

If you've ever done research on working context[^contextresearch] — especially software-related context — you've probably come across Gerald Weinberg's graph illustrating the general guideline that, for every additional task added to our daily workload, we lose 20% of our time.

{{< caption src="/images/context-switching-penalty.jpg"
            align="aligncenter"
            alt="context switching penalty"
            attr="Quality Software Management"
            attrlink="http://amzn.to/1EJOoJ1" >}}
{{< /caption >}}

[^contextresearch]:
    No? Just me?

This is commonly referred to as a "context switching penalty" — which is a fancy way of saying that every time I have to stop doing one thing and start working on another thing, there's lag time. And it adds up *fast*.

Put another way: **if you’re working on 4 simultaneous projects, only 3 hours and 15 minutes of an 8-hour day will actually be productive.**

### You're Bad at Multitasking, and I Can Prove It

Here's an exercise, borrowed from [Jim Benson's](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/expert/context-switching-why-limit-your-wip-iv/) article on the same subject, to get a real-world idea of time loss to context switching.

{{< caption src="/images/multitasking-exercise.jpg"

    The Unwinnable Multitasking Challenge
{{< /caption >}}

Grab a pen, paper, and a timer. Make three columns on the paper. 

You're going to be writing three lists:

- In the first column, write the numbers 1–10
- In the second, Roman numerals I–X
- In the third, letters A–J

**There's a twist, though: you have to switch columns after each character.** Write a number, a numeral, then a letter, and then back to a number.

Start a timer and see how long it takes you. Ready? Go.

How long did it take you? I timed myself at 40 seconds.[^switchingtime]

[^switchingtime]:
    I also screwed up the Roman numeral for 8 and had to correct it.

Now do the same exercise, but this time do it in three separate steps: first write out 1–10, *then* numerals I–X, *then* A–J. How long did it take you?

My time: 24 seconds.

Now, this is a pretty basic example. I know the alphabet, counting, and Roman numerals all very well, so I didn't have to actually *create* anything to get this done. Yet I was still 40% faster[^weinberg] when I did them in sequence rather than all at once.

[^weinberg]:
    Note that this is *exactly* in line with Weinberg's estimation of 40% time loss for 3 simultaneous tasks, by the way.

**For each task, I had to shift into a different mental construct, and that takes a little bit of extra time.**

This *shattered* my view of productivity.

I had been holding myself up as this paragon of high-output heroism: building fantastic software with my left hand, responding to client emails with my right hand, and selling new projects with the Bluetooth headset I'm only willing to wear indoors when no one can see me.

But this glittering champion of business I had imagined myself to be was actually a sputtering, janky pile of shit, full of leaks and billowing black smoke that everyone but me clearly saw as a warning sign.

I needed to sort my shit out, and *fast.*

### Group Tasks by Context

My original approach to efficiency was to touch everything, and often. Incremental progress, showing everyone that I was, in fact, working.

But very little was, in fact, being *done.*

At first, my revised approach felt like I was being a dick. I was going to purposefully ignore everyone who wasn't my Next Thing.

In practice, it was a little bit like loading a Pez dispenser: I put all of my tasks in a pile ordered by priority, but once the pile was made I could only look at the task on top.

{{< caption src="/images/pez-dispenser.jpg"
            align="aligncenter"
            alt="Pez dispenser"
            attr="Wikihow"
            attrlink="http://www.wikihow.com/Fill-a-Pez-Dispenser#/Image:Fill-a-Pez-Dispenser-Step-5.jpg" >}}
    One thing at a time.
{{< /caption >}}

Since I only had one thing to work on, I'd exert all my focus on it until — with surprising speed, it turned out — I'd send the completed project hurtling toward a happy client or team member.

This had three major benefits for me:

1. **I learned to break large projects into smaller tasks.** This helped me become far more realistic about what needed to be done and how long it would take to complete. Which didn't hurt my ability to stay focused on results over time.
2. **I was able to make impactful progress on multiple projects in sequence** without the flailing, unfocused efforts of before.
3. **I could set "clear email" or "call sales leads" as a task,** and when it came up on my list, that was the *only* thing I'd work on until it was done.

My gut said I'd be slower and less effective if I only worked on one thing at a time. But reality proved me to be completely, embarrassingly wrong.

## Goal #3: Treat Time Off Like a Job

I have a compulsion to stay busy.

Raised on the "idle hands are the devil's playground"-type idioms that (grand)parents rattle off to keep kids from actually *fusing* with the couch, I have a deep sense of guilt around twiddling thumbs, resting on laurels, and in general fucking off and/or around.

And so, in response to my general aversion to what I used to call "wasting time", I developed a pseudo-productivity impulse — an emotional tic of sorts that left me unable to sit still for more than five minutes without the urge to "knock out a few quick emails" or "tackle one of the Quick Wins[^jargon] from my todo list".

[^jargon]: Another side effect of this ostensibly can-do attitude is that I've picked up a lot of bullshit industry jargon that I regularly hear coming out of my mouth despite multiple internally-registered complaints.

My desire to Stay Busy made me an indispensable tool for my clients (and before that, managers and various higher-ups), but it also directly contributed to my dangerously unhealthy lifestyle and the [death of my beard](https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a).

And — most importantly — **"staying busy" was holding me back from doing my best work.**

### Flow, Focus, and Short-Term Burnout

Contrary to my knee-jerk recoil from relaxation, **the introduction of actual breaks into my work[^actualbreaks] boosted my productivity significantly.**

[^actualbreaks]: 15 minutes screen-free for every 90 minutes worked. No exceptions.

There was this feeling I used to get after a long stretch of high-focus work — say 4 hours hammering on a complex software project — where the world would go out of focus and I'd feel less a part of things than somehow *apart* from them, like I was looking at reality through frosted glass.

It felt like I'd strapped my brain to a rocket and pushed it just beyond the exosphere, and to stop working meant the discomfort of reentry and the disorientation[^howtobeaperson] of being in situations that don't involve logical operators.

[^howtobeaperson]: My girlfriend describes it as watching me "try to remember how to be a person." It feels a lot like that, too.

It seemed to get worse the longer I spent staring at a screen. But I also felt the long periods of focus were necessary if I was going to keep a strong [flow state](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en) going.

The idea of sacrificing flow — a.k.a. *in the zone*, *on a roll*, *killing it* — for any reason seemed unwise. Especially considering I'd just implemented insane restrictions on distractions and communications to protect my ability to get into a flow state.

But I also knew that my marathon working sessions were causing problems: after my first deep dive, the rest of my day was spent in a not-quite-there haze. I was short with friends without realizing it. I wasn't able to get into a second deep dive on most days. I'd often end up spending the time after a four-hour binge staring without focus at a screen or a friend, more or less *fucking done* for the day.

### Take Actual Breaks While Working

I pushed through deep misgivings to start experimenting with what "optimal" meant for me in terms of focus and endurance.

How long could I work before I hit that nothing-else-will-be-accomplished-today stupor? Did it make me better at getting a second (or even third) working round in? Could I finish working and interact with humans in a way that I was one of them?

I read about the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but 25 minutes wasn't long enough; I felt rushed and ineffective.

I tried three-hour intervals and ended up fried after the first one.

After a while, I found [Tony Schwartz's book](http://amzn.to/1fgWXzr) about working, which mentioned something called [ultradian rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm) that apparently regulate how long we can feasibly work. It's kind of like [REM cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep), but all day long: **after about 90 minutes of work, our bodies feel like they're under attack**[^attack] and start pumping stress-response chemicals to help us get through the "danger" we're facing. This, I decided, is where the haze was coming from.

[^attack]:
    This sounds stupid, but it's something to do with being highly focused for longer than our bodies have evolved to endure. "Hey! Hey! You're staring at the box for too long! What's in the box? [*What's in the fucking baaahhhhx?!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=41&v=1giVzxyoclE)"

So I tried a [90-minute working block](http://lengstorf.com/scheduling-maximum-productivity/) with a short break, and found out I could fit 3–4 of these into a day without feeling totally spent and unfit for human interaction.

I also found that I was getting *more* flow-quality work done. After all, 3–4 high-quality work blocks is 4.5–6 hours of flow-quality work — my old approach usually yielded a single 4-hour block in before I'd burn out for the day.

### At Least Once a Week, Do Nothing

Fresh off my realization that I was, thus far, *completely fucking wrong* about everything I thought had been making me productive, I fell down a research rabbit hole.

I came across a pile of research telling me [walking outside boosts creativity](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/want-to-be-more-creative-take-a-walk/).

Then I found out [daydreaming activates complex problem-solving centers in the brain](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511180702.htm).

There's even research about what I considered the *ultimate time-waster*: [looking at baby animals makes you better at problem solving](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046362).

The research said, unequivocally, that **it’s critical to take real time away from work each week.**[^weekend]

[^weekend]: Somewhere along the way, the concept of a traditional weekend disappeared from my reality. It wasn't that I wanted one and it wasn't available to me; it was more that I just didn't like the absence of work for something as arbitrary as which day of the week it was — if I didn't have anything better to do, why the hell wouldn't I put in some billable hours?

So I took on one last huge personal change: I started taking at least one day per week *completely* off screens and work. Instead, I do anything from [braving a tourist trap](http://lengstorf.com/navigating-the-tourist-trap/) to running errands — it doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it happens exclusively in [meatspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology).

And to my (continually diminishing) surprise, I saw further improvement in my performance. My days off left me excited to get back to it — **time off created distance that helped me remember why I like what I do.**

It also left down time where I could let ideas roll around in my subconscious. This led to more than a few good brain-splosions that seemingly came out of nowhere while I was staring off into space or talking about something unrelated with a friend.

**Further reading: [Take a Break](http://lengstorf.com/better-productivity-work-less/)**

## Building New Habits Means Consistency

Following my typical trajectory, after I learned all of these things about myself, I made a concerted effort to ignore them and continue doing things the way I'd always done them.

I'd already worn in the grooves for my existing habits, and building new habits is *hard* — it was very easy to convince myself that the upfront effort in changing things wasn't worth it after all.

But I'd seen the benefits. I'd *lived* the benefits. So my rational, results-oriented, logical mind — after a prolonged, unnecessarily painful struggle — was able to wrestle my idiot lizard brain into cooperating[^cooperating] while I worked to ingrain new defaults.

[^cooperating]: Maybe "cooperating" is too strong a word; "not actively blocking progress" is probably more accurate.

**Further reading: [Do It Every Day](http://lengstorf.com/do-it-every-day/)**

It was difficult, and I had frequent relapses at first. I still have the occasional relapse now. But overall, I saw the benefits, realized I needed to make changes, and since then I've put in the work — every day, though it gets easier with time — to make sure that I'm working in a way that both makes me better at working *and* leaves me with more time for living a life outside of work.

## What Happens Next

**Today, we talked about how our working habits need to change if we're ever going to have enough free time to do the things we want to do.** It's not easy to make large changes, but if we trust the research and keep an eye on the improvements we'll see — and we *will* see them — it gets easier with time. And the effort is well worth it.

**Tomorrow, we'll talk about getting out of our own way** by developing a better understanding of our own emotional attachments to things. We may not realize it, but many of us are living inside imaginary cages for no reason other than "that's the way we've always done it."
