So far, we've talked a lot about the theory of long-term travel: the [modern workplace is broken]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-1.md" >}}); modern workers have [bad habits]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-2.md" >}}); many of us tend to be [our own biggest obstacles]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-3.md" >}}) to new experiences.

But theory only gets us ready for the adventure *in theory*. When it's time to actually go, we have to move past the theory and lay out concrete steps we'll need to take.

**Today's lesson is pretty dense, so be sure to bookmark it to use for reference** — it's too much to try and remember, and this stuff is really important.

Here's what we'll be covering:

* [**Preparation**]({{< ref "#preparation" >}})
    - [Get Your Travel Gear]({{< ref "#travel-gear" >}})
        + [Simplify your style to simplify your packing]({{< ref "#uniform" >}})
        + [Get the right electronics for traveling]({{< ref "#electronics" >}})
        + [Remember: you don't need much]({{< ref "#minimalism" >}})

This is different from the other lessons in that it's intended more to be a checklist than a single-sitting read. **Reference this guide throughout your preparations to save yourself a fair amount of headache.**

## Be Prepared {#preparation}

In this section, we'll be going over various things that will need to be in order *before* leaving: luggage, what to pack, how to organize money, and how to stay in touch.

### Get Your Travel Gear {#travel-gear}

The biggest difference for long-term travelers is that **we have to carry everything we own through an airport or train station every month or two.**

That means we need not only to pack light, but to ensure we have everything we need — and nothing we don't.

#### Simplify your style to simplify your packing {#uniform}

One solution to the challenge of packing light is to simplify your wardrobe significantly.

In my case, I found that [wearing a "uniform"]({{< ref "blog/travel-essentials-uniform.md" >}}) — black t-shirt, grey shorts/pants, black shoes — removed my need to pack a huge array of options. It also allows me to remain semi-fashionable without dedicating any energy to shopping or outfit choice.

For a full list of the clothing I pack, see my [carry-on clothing checklist]({{< ref "blog/carry-on-clothing-packing-list.md" >}}).

**Further reading: [On Uniforms: Why I Wear the Same Outfit Every Day]({{< ref "blog/travel-essentials-uniform.md" >}})**

#### Get the right electronics for traveling {#electronics}



- Packing list

#### Remember: you don't need much {#minimalism}

- Do more with less

### Avoid International Fees and Foreign Transaction Fees

#### Choose credit cards that don't charge international fees

Credit cards, chip and PIN, different fees, links to cards without those fees.

- Chase Sapphire Preferred
- American Express

#### Get online-only bank accounts that don't charge fees

Bank accounts without fees, easy access, allowing for in-branch deposits (in case someone can't do direct deposit).

- Schwab
- Capital One 360

#### Use free apps to send money fee-free

Apps for sending money (Square Cash has no fees).

### Choose Tools for Keeping in Touch


#### How to keep a local number

Use Google Voice with a Skype number and a local SIM to keep a US-based number that rings a foreign phone.

#### Send texts and pictures (SMS/MMS) for free internationally

Use WhatsApp for texting, Viber for international calling.

#### Use free video calling apps to keep a personal connection

Google Hangouts, Facetime, Skype for video calling.

#### Get an unlocked phone so you can have local data

Buy an unlocked phone. Learn how to get prepaid SIM cards.

#### Set up mail forwarding

You'll need a "home address" sometimes (not a P.O. box), so make sure you have a non-P.O. address for mail.


## How to Book Travel Cheaply and Hassle-Free

### Find a Great Place to Live

#### Airbnb is a hotel that doesn't suck

#### Shop locally for even cheaper accommodations

Talking to other people who travel full-time, the general consensus is that you can save extra money by looking for rentals in person. Many local folks don't know about or use Airbnb, so the cheapest rentals are usually found by wandering and asking around.

For me, the ease of booking online — plus the done-for-you aspects of renting — make Airbnb worth paying a little extra, but if you're a deal-hunter, this may be worth looking into.

#### Stay longer in each place


### Don't Waste Time Booking Flights

#### Use flight comparison sites

Google Flights and Skyscanner compare prices from tons of airlines, so you can be reasonably sure you're getting the best price.

#### Keep dates flexible and save tons of money

In Google Flights, check the calendar view to see if there's a day a little earlier or later that will save you a shitload of money.

#### Don't forget to pay for checked bags in advance

Air travel is *really cheap* in Europe. But if you have more than one carry-on (backpacks count!) or if it's too heavy, you have to pay in advance or you'll end up paying a small fortune in surcharges. When in doubt, pay for extra baggage.

## Avoid Travel Hassles

### Understand How Visas Work

#### Know which countries require you to apply for a visa

Thailand, for example.

#### Get familiar with the Schengen Area

90 days in Spain means you can't go to Italy next. Plan accordingly.

### Be Prepared for Customs

#### Have an onward ticket

Customs agents have one job: keep people from entering the country and staying illegally. They need to be sure you're not going to overstay your visa and take work from the citizens of that country. That means they'll ask questions about how you support yourself, how much money you have in savings, and where you're going next. They're not being dicks; it's their job.

#### Be ready to show proof of income and/or savings

In addition to making sure you're actually going to leave, they might try to ensure you can afford your trip. Thailand, for example, requires that you have at least 10,000THB (just under $300) before they'll let you enter on a 30-day tourist visa.

Be ready to show you bank account balance. This doesn't happen often (I've only had to do it once), but it's a possibility.

#### Don't be a smart-ass

I told a customs agent I was technically homeless. He was not amused. Sarcasm is not appreciated, and if you rub a customs agent the wrong way, sarcasm can result in you being held for extra questioning. Be polite, answer the questions truthfully, don't volunteer additional information, and get it over with quickly.

### Cover Your Ass with Traveler's Insurance

#### Get health insurance that covers you while traveling

#### Consider a supplemental insurance plan for your gear

This may not be necessary — I prefer to just keep a cash reserve rather than paying a monthly fee. But that all depends on how much your gear is worth in sum.

### Keep Track of Important Documents

#### Keep photos of critical documents in the cloud

Use Dropbox, Google Drive, your email — anything that allows you to get to those docs even if everything you own is stolen.

#### Keep original documents somewhere safe

Documents you don't need — birth certificate, Social Security card, etc. — shouldn't be kept in your luggage. Put them in a lockbox at a bank, in your parents' safe, or with your lawyer. If someone steals your passport, it's best that they don't also have all of your other ID documents as well.

## Understand the Tax Implications of Long-Term Travel

### Get an Accountant

I'm not an accountant, and this isn't accounting advice. Double-check anything you read here with a professional.

### Learn How Federal Tax Breaks Work

#### Take advantage of the Foreign Earned Income Exemption

#### You still owe self-employment tax

This is Social Security and Medicare, which aren't optional. This ends up being around 15–16% of your income, and you *will* have to pay it.

I think you're supposed to send it in quarterly to avoid extra fees. Check with your accountant.

#### Save the money you would owe in taxes, just in case

Think of it like a year-end bonus if the FEIE claim is accepted. You don't want to be left holding a $25K tax bill if you claim the FEIE and find out you didn't actually qualify.

Be safe. Don't take chances with the IRS. Tax code is tricky, and you can never be sure you got it right.

### Don't Forget About State Tax

#### Every state is different about taxes

Some states consider you a resident even if you're not in the state, which means you would owe taxes. Check with your accountant.

#### If you can, move to a state without income tax first

If you can become a resident of a state that doesn't have income tax, do it.

### Seriously: Talk to an Accountant

This money stuff is complex and confusing. Don't leave it up to chance. Go talk to an accountant, and give some serious thought to letting a professional handle it on your behalf.
