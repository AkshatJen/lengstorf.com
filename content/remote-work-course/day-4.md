This lesson is different from days 1–3.

So far, we've talked a lot about the theory of long-term travel: the [modern workplace is broken]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-1.md" >}}); modern workers have [bad habits]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-2.md" >}}); many of us tend to be [our own biggest obstacles]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-3.md" >}}) to new experiences.

This is the stuff that allows us to take control of our lives and do things that might seem "too big" — like packing a bag and exploring the world while making a living.

But theory only gets us ready for the adventure *in theory*. When it's time to actually go, we have to move past the theory and lay out concrete steps we'll need to take.

Today, we're going to focus on the practical aspects of traveling: what to pack, how to prepare, and other tips and tricks that make travel fun instead of a huge, stressful nightmare.

**This lesson is pretty dense, so be sure to bookmark it to use for reference throughout your preparations** — it's too much to try and remember, and this stuff is really important.

## What to Pack for a Carry-On Lifestyle {#packing}

The biggest change between living in the same place and living in different cities around the world is in the way we have to look at our stuff.

Every month or two, we'll need to carry everything we own to our next destination. This often includes the odd flight of stairs in a metro station, crumbling cobblestone streets, and miles upon miles of airport corridors.

It changes the relationship we have with physical objects. Instead of, "How much do I like this?" we ask, "Do I like this enough to carry it through JFK?"

In this section I'm going over my clothing and electronics. I'm leaving out the mundane stuff, like toiletries — just stick to the "only what I *really* need" rule and you're probably fine.

### The Packing List, Part I: What to Wear {#packing-clothing}

A carry-on suitcase will carry about six days' worth of clothing.[^dude] This means we need to prune our wardrobes down to just the essentials.

(For a woman's approach to packing, check out [Marisa's take on carry-on packing](https://medium.com/live-happy/oh-my-god-i-have-nothing-to-wear-dressing-for-extended-travel-60359781814d).)

[^dude]:
    I say this as a 5'10", 240lb dude. Your results may vary.

The key to carry-on suitcase style is interoperability: each item of clothing should work with every other item in your bag. This way, you can ensure the maximum utility in each piece of clothing.[^dark]

[^dark]:
    You can also get dressed in the dark. Not that it's important — it's just possible.

#### The Clothing in My Bag Right Now {#packing-list-clothing}

#### Consider Wearing a Uniform {#packing-uniform}

One solution to the challenge of packing light is to simplify your wardrobe significantly.

The best decision I made in preparation for my trip was to pick out a "uniform": a [basic outfit I wear every day]({{< ref "blog/travel-essentials-uniform.md" >}}).

For me, this is a plain black t-shirt, dark pants or shorts, and casual shoes, plus basic accessories: a watch and a belt.

I'm fashionable-ish, comfortable, and I never have to worry about whether I have something to wear: my uniform can be dressed up with a sport coat, or made incredibly casual with flip flops.

### The Packing List, Part II: Electronics {#packing-electronics}

Similar to clothing, there's only so much extra space and weight you'll want to deal with for electronics. Sure, it's *possible* to get a custom [Pelican case](http://bit.ly/1MgUXp9) and lug around a ton of gear — but for me, there was more value in choosing only the things that *really* add value for my day-to-day life.

#### The Electronics in My Bag Right Now {#packing-list-electronics}

Here's what's in my bag right now:

### Remember: You Don't Need Much {#packing-minimalism}

The temptation with travel is to bring a lot of stuff, "just in case".

{{< caption src="/images/too-much-luggage.jpg"
            align="alignright"
            alt="don't pack too much stuff"
            attr="Scarlette Begonia"
            attrlink="http://anefforttoevolve.com/2015/02/15/got-baggage/" >}}
  Nobody needs this much crap to travel.
{{< /caption >}}

Resist that urge. It's a trap that leads to sweating like a pig while dragging a hundred pounds of "just in case" up the out-of-service escalator in a Barcelona metro station.

Most things we instinctively think to pack "just in case" go unused. And most of the stuff we wouldn't normally pack that we end up needing isn't part of that "just in case" inventory.

So figure out what you'll actually use every day. If you find yourself needing something you didn't pack, you can *almost always* buy what you need in the city you're staying in — and usually you can rent or borrow it.[^leave-behind]

[^leave-behind]:
    We have purchased and left behind all sorts of fun things: spatulas, buckets, dish soap, umbrellas. We've also successfully remained alive without needing any of the miscellaneous shit that used to weigh down our bags before.

### Avoid International Fees and Foreign Transaction Fees

#### Choose credit cards that don't charge international fees

Credit cards, chip and PIN, different fees, links to cards without those fees.

- Chase Sapphire Preferred
- American Express

#### Get online-only bank accounts that don't charge fees

Bank accounts without fees, easy access, allowing for in-branch deposits (in case someone can't do direct deposit).

- Schwab
- Capital One 360

#### Use free apps to send money fee-free

Apps for sending money (Square Cash has no fees).

### Choose Tools for Keeping in Touch


#### How to keep a local number

Use Google Voice with a Skype number and a local SIM to keep a US-based number that rings a foreign phone.

#### Send texts and pictures (SMS/MMS) for free internationally

Use WhatsApp for texting, Viber for international calling.

#### Use free video calling apps to keep a personal connection

Google Hangouts, Facetime, Skype for video calling.

#### Get an unlocked phone so you can have local data

Buy an unlocked phone. Learn how to get prepaid SIM cards.

#### Set up mail forwarding

You'll need a "home address" sometimes (not a P.O. box), so make sure you have a non-P.O. address for mail.


## How to Book Travel Cheaply and Hassle-Free

### Find a Great Place to Live

#### Airbnb is a hotel that doesn't suck

**Further reading: [How to Use Airbnb Like a Pro]({{< ref "blog/use-airbnb-like-a-pro.md" >}})**

http://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8

#### Shop locally for even cheaper accommodations

Talking to other people who travel full-time, the general consensus is that you can save extra money by looking for rentals in person. Many local folks don't know about or use Airbnb, so the cheapest rentals are usually found by wandering and asking around.

For me, the ease of booking online — plus the done-for-you aspects of renting — make Airbnb worth paying a little extra, but if you're a deal-hunter, this may be worth looking into.

#### Stay longer in each place


### Don't Waste Time Booking Flights

#### Use flight comparison sites

Google Flights and Skyscanner compare prices from tons of airlines, so you can be reasonably sure you're getting the best price.

#### Keep dates flexible and save tons of money

In Google Flights, check the calendar view to see if there's a day a little earlier or later that will save you a shitload of money.

#### Don't forget to pay for checked bags in advance

Air travel is *really cheap* in Europe. But if you have more than one carry-on (backpacks count!) or if it's too heavy, you have to pay in advance or you'll end up paying a small fortune in surcharges. When in doubt, pay for extra baggage.

## Avoid Travel Hassles

### Understand How Visas Work

#### Know which countries require you to apply for a visa

Thailand, for example.

#### Get familiar with the Schengen Area

90 days in Spain means you can't go to Italy next. Plan accordingly.

### Be Prepared for Customs

#### Have an onward ticket

Customs agents have one job: keep people from entering the country and staying illegally. They need to be sure you're not going to overstay your visa and take work from the citizens of that country. That means they'll ask questions about how you support yourself, how much money you have in savings, and where you're going next. They're not being dicks; it's their job.

- https://flyonward.com

#### Be ready to show proof of income and/or savings

In addition to making sure you're actually going to leave, they might try to ensure you can afford your trip. Thailand, for example, requires that you have at least 10,000THB (just under $300) before they'll let you enter on a 30-day tourist visa.

Be ready to show you bank account balance. This doesn't happen often (I've only had to do it once), but it's a possibility.

#### Don't be a smart-ass

I told a customs agent I was technically homeless. He was not amused. Sarcasm is not appreciated, and if you rub a customs agent the wrong way, sarcasm can result in you being held for extra questioning. Be polite, answer the questions truthfully, don't volunteer additional information, and get it over with quickly.

### Cover Your Ass with Traveler's Insurance

#### Get health insurance that covers you while traveling

#### Consider a supplemental insurance plan for your gear

This may not be necessary — I prefer to just keep a cash reserve rather than paying a monthly fee. But that all depends on how much your gear is worth in sum.

### Keep Track of Important Documents

#### Keep photos of critical documents in the cloud

Use Dropbox, Google Drive, your email — anything that allows you to get to those docs even if everything you own is stolen.

#### Keep original documents somewhere safe

Documents you don't need — birth certificate, Social Security card, etc. — shouldn't be kept in your luggage. Put them in a lockbox at a bank, in your parents' safe, or with your lawyer. If someone steals your passport, it's best that they don't also have all of your other ID documents as well.

## Understand the Tax Implications of Long-Term Travel

### Get an Accountant

I'm not an accountant, and this isn't accounting advice. Double-check anything you read here with a professional.

### Learn How Federal Tax Breaks Work

#### Take advantage of the Foreign Earned Income Exemption

#### You still owe self-employment tax

This is Social Security and Medicare, which aren't optional. This ends up being around 15–16% of your income, and you *will* have to pay it.

I think you're supposed to send it in quarterly to avoid extra fees. Check with your accountant.

#### Save the money you would owe in taxes, just in case

Think of it like a year-end bonus if the FEIE claim is accepted. You don't want to be left holding a $25K tax bill if you claim the FEIE and find out you didn't actually qualify.

Be safe. Don't take chances with the IRS. Tax code is tricky, and you can never be sure you got it right.

### Don't Forget About State Tax

#### Every state is different about taxes

Some states consider you a resident even if you're not in the state, which means you would owe taxes. Check with your accountant.

#### If you can, move to a state without income tax first

If you can become a resident of a state that doesn't have income tax, do it.

- Get a list of all states without income tax

### Seriously: Talk to an Accountant

This money stuff is complex and confusing. Don't leave it up to chance. Go talk to an accountant, and give some serious thought to letting a professional handle it on your behalf.
