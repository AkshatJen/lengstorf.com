This lesson is different from days 1–3.

So far, we've talked a lot about the theory of long-term travel: the [modern workplace is broken]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-1.md" >}}); modern workers have [bad habits]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-2.md" >}}); many of us tend to be [our own biggest obstacles]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-3.md" >}}) to new experiences.

This is the stuff that allows us to take control of our lives and do things that might seem "too big" — like packing a bag and exploring the world while making a living.

But theory only gets us ready for the adventure *in theory*. When it's time to actually go, we have to move past the theory and lay out concrete steps we'll need to take.

Today, we're going to focus on the practical aspects of traveling: what to pack, how to prepare, and other tips and tricks that make travel fun instead of a huge, stressful nightmare.

**This lesson is pretty dense, so be sure to bookmark it to use for reference throughout your preparations** — it's too much to try and remember, and this stuff is really important.

## What to Pack for a Carry-On Lifestyle {#packing}

The biggest change between living in the same place and living in different cities around the world is in the way we have to look at our stuff.

Every month or two, we'll need to carry everything we own to our next destination. This often includes the odd flight of stairs in a metro station, crumbling cobblestone streets, and miles upon miles of airport corridors.

It changes the relationship we have with physical objects. Instead of, "How much do I like this?" we ask, "Do I like this enough to carry it through JFK?"

In this section I'm going over my clothing and electronics. I'm leaving out the mundane stuff, like toiletries — just stick to the "only what I *really* need" rule and you're probably fine.

### The Packing List, Part I: Luggage and Storage {#packing-luggage}

The secret to excellent carry-on packing is to have excellent carry-on luggage. After a few poor decisions and a good amount of trial and error, I'm currently using this setup:

{{% columns %}}
- [Briggs & Riley Carry-On](http://amzn.to/1UU7HBp)
- [Rudsak Leather Shoulder Bag](http://bit.ly/1W1Umtb)
- [Eagle Creek Compression Sac](http://amzn.to/1UUviHC)
- [Reusable Tote Bag](http://amzn.to/1UUbM8J)
- [Eagle Creek Toiletry Kit](http://amzn.to/1UUbRcx)
- [Plastic Soap Container](http://amzn.to/1OWWVZy)
- [Small Zipper Pouch for Cables](http://amzn.to/1Lg4hbl)
{{% /columns %}}

I used to try to look rugged with a big backpack, but I realized quickly that I'm willing to trade "rugged" for "not sweaty and miserable" in the airport. A wheeled carry-on is a must for me. I like the Briggs & Riley bag because it's got the right amount of storage and it feels sturdy.[^sturdy]

[^sturdy]:
    Nine months later, I can vouch for the sturdiness of the bag. It hasn't shown any sign of wear, despite being dragged through cobblestone streets, up and down metro station staircases, and shoved into lots of overhead bins that were barely big enough to hold it.

I've always liked the messenger bag approach, but I gave it up for a [small travel backpack](http://amzn.to/10uwYxe) when I first started traveling. After about six months, I decided to go back to a leather messenger bag. It's not as ideal for carrying the bag long distances, but I rarely have to haul it more than a mile — so in this case I'm choosing form over function.

Compression sacs are a huge space saver: put in your clothes, zip it, roll it to press the air out, and suddenly you're only using about half the space in your bag.

A reusable tote is perfect for groceries, day trips, hikes, or anywhere I want to go but don't want to damage my leather bag. It's also good for laundry, and it rolls up to a pocket-sized ball.

The rest of my storage stuff is pretty standard: plastic bags and TSA-approved containers for my toiletries, a small zippered pouch to keep cables and small electronics organized, and a way to store my soap — because I'm weird and I like to have my own soap instead of using whatever's at the apartment.

### The Packing List, Part II: What to Wear {#packing-clothing}

A carry-on suitcase will carry about six days' worth of clothing.[^dude] This means we need to prune our wardrobes down to just the essentials.

(I can only speak from a men's perspective; for a woman's perspective on the subject, check out Marisa's [carry-on packing tips for women](https://medium.com/live-happy/oh-my-god-i-have-nothing-to-wear-dressing-for-extended-travel-60359781814d).)

[^dude]:
    I say this as a 5'10", 240lb dude. Your results may vary.

The key to carry-on suitcase style is interoperability: each item of clothing should work with every other item in your bag. This way, you can ensure the maximum utility in each piece of clothing.[^dark]

[^dark]:
    You can also get dressed in the dark. Not that it's important — but you could totally do it.

Here's what I pack:

### Consider Wearing a Uniform {#packing-uniform}

One solution to the challenge of packing light is to simplify your wardrobe significantly.

The best decision I made in preparation for my trip was to pick out a "uniform": a [basic outfit I wear every day]({{< ref "blog/travel-essentials-uniform.md" >}}).

For me, this is a plain black t-shirt, dark pants or shorts, and casual shoes, plus basic accessories: a watch and a belt.

I'm fashionable-ish, comfortable, and I never have to worry about whether I have something to wear: my uniform can be dressed up with a sport coat, or made incredibly casual with flip flops.

### The Packing List, Part III: Electronics {#packing-electronics}

Similar to clothing, there's only so much extra space and weight you'll want to deal with for electronics. Sure, it's *possible* to get a custom [Pelican case](http://bit.ly/1MgUXp9) and lug around a ton of gear — but for me, there was more value in choosing only the things that *really* add value for my day-to-day life.

Here's what's in my bag right now:

{{% columns %}}
- [15" MacBook Pro](http://amzn.to/1VRGz8G)
- [Unlocked iPhone 6](http://amzn.to/1VRGzVX)
- [Amazon Kindle Paperwhite](http://amzn.to/1UHu7Lj)
- [Bose Mini SoundLink](http://amzn.to/1UHuc1M)
- [Apple earbuds](http://amzn.to/1M1YKUj)

### Remember: You Don't Need Much {#packing-minimalism}

The temptation with travel is to bring a lot of stuff, "just in case".

{{< caption src="/images/too-much-luggage.jpg"
            align="alignright"
            alt="don't pack too much stuff"
            attr="Scarlette Begonia"
            attrlink="http://anefforttoevolve.com/2015/02/15/got-baggage/" >}}
  This only makes sense if it's four people's luggage.
{{< /caption >}}

Resist that urge. It's a trap that leads to sweating like a pig while dragging a hundred pounds of "just in case" up the out-of-service escalator in a Barcelona metro station.

Most things we instinctively think to pack "just in case" go unused. And the things we end up needing aren't part of that "just in case" inventory, anyways.

So figure out what you'll actually use every day. If you find yourself needing something you didn't pack, you can *almost always* buy what you need in the city you're staying in — and usually you can rent or borrow it.[^leave-behind]

[^leave-behind]:
    We have purchased and left behind all sorts of fun things: spatulas, buckets, dish soap, umbrellas. We've also successfully remained alive without needing any of the miscellaneous shit that used to weigh down our bags before.

## How to Access Money Abroad Without Extra Fees {#money}

When you leave the U.S., some of the ease of banking gets left behind. For example, you'll rarely find a branch you can walk into for help.

So before you go, you'll want to make sure you can get to your money easily and — more importantly — without paying huge penalties for accessing your accounts outside the country.

### Make Sure You Have EMV-Capable Cards {#money-emv}

Everywhere in the world except the United States[^chip-cards] is using [chip and PIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) (or EMV) for payments. This is because EMV is more secure and harder to forge.

[^chip-cards]:
    This is changing. U.S. card issuers announced a plan that includes shifting liability for non-EMV purchases as of [October, 2015](http://www.emv-connection.com/emv-migration-driven-by-payment-brand-milestones/), which should result in a mass migration of U.S. businesses to the new system.

So the ol' swipe-and-sign method is unwieldy abroad. Many businesses won't be familiar with non-chip cards, and you may find yourself trying to explain how swiping works across dual barriers of culture and language, which... just call your credit and debit card issuers and ask for chip cards. Trust me.

Most issuers are already sending chip cards, so if you call and ask you should have a replacement card[^replacements] within a week or two.

[^replacements]:
    My card numbers didn't change, but the expiration dates did. This meant I didn't have to update most of my recurring payments and such.

### Learn About Foreign Transaction Fees {#money-extra fees}

I grew up in Montana, where it was common for high school seniors to take weekend trips across the Canadian border — the drinking age was 18, after all.

On one of these trips, my friend Phil used his debit card to pay for everything. A few days in, his card was declined. He did some mental math, felt like it had to be a mistake, and called his bank.

Turns out his bank charged an extra fee for every transaction: the *higher* of $5 or 3% of the transaction. He'd paid something like $100[^hssd] in fees in just a couple days.

[^hssd]:
    Which in high school senior dollars brushes against the theoretical [limit of infinity](http://bit.ly/1EU0Mq0).

Don't be like Phil. Use a card that doesn't charge fees.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Handling and Accessing Money]({{< ref "#money" >}})</small>

### Get Credit Cards Without Foreign Transaction Fees {#money-credit-cards}

If used responsibly, credit cards are actually a great way to make money. My credit card companies pay me upwards of $35 each month just for using the cards.

But if I was paying foreign transaction fees, the rewards wouldn't be enough to cover it. So before I left, I switched to credit cards that met two goals:

1. Decent rewards that I could redeem for statement credit.
2. No fees for using the cards outside the U.S.

After a little research, I landed on two cards.

**1\. [Chase Sapphire Preferred](http://bit.ly/1UK10Hu)**

This is my main card. It's a Visa, so it's accepted basically everywhere, and the rewards are simple: 1% cash back for everything I spend.[^fancy]

[^fancy]:
    As a bonus, the card is made of metal or something, so it feels pretty fancy. I get to pretend I'm important when someone takes the card, weighs it in his hand, and gives the appreciative lip-purse-and-nod-with-eyebrow-raise.

The only catch with this card is the annual fee — but if you're paying it off at the end of each month, you'll make *way more* in rewards than you'll pay each year.

**2\. [Delta SkyMiles Platinum American Express](http://amex.co/1LpGdOU)**

This card used to be my main card. When I was in the U.S., it was hugely valuable to me because of the Delta bonuses. However, most of the countries I'm hanging out in these days aren't serviced (cheaply, at least) by Delta or its partners, so I'm not getting quite so much from the card.

In addition to no foreign transaction fees, it offers mileage bonuses, SkyMiles[^mqm] for all purchases, a companion ticket to bring someone along with you at no additional cost once a year, and other perks, like priority boarding.

[^mqm]:
    All the airlines are changing their mileage plans to suck a little more, so the SkyMiles are redeemable for flights, but they don't count toward your Frequent Flyer status. If you want to get that Platinum or Diamond luggage tag, your miles have to come from Delta flights.

Depending on your plans — basically, how much do you fly, and how much of that flying is done in the U.S. — this card may be worth the annual fee.

For a full roundup, you can search for "credit cards with no foreign transaction fees", or check out [this article](http://bit.ly/1EU47FD) that lists some good options.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Handling and Accessing Money]({{< ref "#money" >}})</small>

### Watch Out for Hidden Costs When Paying By Card {#money-hidden-costs}

When you pay with a card in some cities — especially cities with a strong tourism industry — the card reader may ask if you'd like to process the transaction in USD. It also makes the "no" option look really scary, like it'll cancel the transaction.

**Don't choose to pay in USD.** The exchange rate used is terrible, and you'll end up paying 1–5% more than you should.

Basically, this is something added by the card processors as a way to take advantage of clueless tourists. But you're going to save money by processing the transaction in the local currency, so press that scary "no" button and pay in Euros.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Handling and Accessing Money]({{< ref "#money" >}})</small>

### Get Bank Accounts Without Foreign ATM Fees {#money-bank}

In many countries, paying by card just isn't an option. In Thailand, for example, the vast majority of businesses simply can't afford to pay the fees associated with credit card processing.

This means you'll need to pull cash out of an ATM.[^cash]

[^cash]:
    Also, it's just a good idea to carry some cash at all times for tipping and small purchases. I typically keep $100–200 in the local currency on me. That's enough to handle most unexpected trouble, but not so much that if I lose my wallet I'm going to be completely screwed.

Plus, if you're a remote worker, you'll need to be able to receive money into your account, deposit checks, and so on.

After a little research, I settled on a [Charles Schwab checking account](http://bit.ly/1NvejXS). It doesn't charge foreign ATM fees, pays a tiny bit of interest, and reimburses ATM fees charged by ATM owners.

Schwab focuses on online-only banking, which means it's perfect for those of us who won't be near a physical branch. Mobile check deposits are painless, and their customer support has been top notch whenever I have questions.

There are several options for fee-free banks in addition to Schwab. [Other](http://nerd.me/1M3N57u) [companies](http://nerd.me/1M3N57u) have posted roundups that offer additional information.

### Be Aware of ATM Skimming and Protect Yourself {#money-atm-skimming}

Unfortunately, there's a fringe population of utter shitbags in the world. And because these shitbags exist, the rest of us need to be mindful of what's going on around us so we don't end up funding some shitbag's way of life.

One brand of shitbag behavior to be aware of is called "ATM skimming" — in a nutshell, the shitbag places a small device over the top of the ATM's card reader that "skims" your card info, then uses a small camera to catch your PIN.

You can prevent this with a few simple precautions:

1. Try to use ATMs at banks when possible, because there are typically security cameras to discourage this kind of nonsense.
2. Jiggle the card reader. If it feels loose, don't use the ATM. Better safe than sorry.
3. Look for anything weird near the ATM, like a plastic container full of flyers. If you see one, check the sides and bottom for a camera.
4. Cover your hand while you enter your PIN. That way a camera can't see the PIN anyways.

There's no reason to be paranoid — this happens in the U.S., too — but be aware that it exists. Keep an eye on your accounts[^mint] to see if anything you don't recognize comes out, and set sane daily withdrawal limits ($500 or less from ATMs, for example) on your cards.

[^mint]:
    I use [Mint](http://bit.ly/1ilmKYZ) to monitor all my accounts in the same place. Once a day, I check my transactions and balances to make sure I've got a grip on where I stand financially.

You can't guarantee no one will get their hands on your info, but you *can* guarantee that they can't clean you out in a single day with a couple simple steps. Again: better safe than sorry.

### Use Apps to Send and Receive Money Free {#money-apps}

Since I'm traveling with Marisa, we end up splitting a lot of our expenses. To make sure things even out, we occasionally need to send each other money.

To avoid dealing with cash while also avoiding fees, we turned to apps that allow us to make transfers for free.

Our preference is the [Square Cash](https://cash.me/app/XJKFMJG) app, but there are lots of options now for sending money between family and friends without fees.

Some of the most popular are:

{{% columns %}}
- [Square Cash](https://cash.me/app/XJKFMJG)
- [Google Wallet](https://www.google.com/wallet/)
- [PayPal](https://paypal.com)
- [Facebook Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/919479321397007)
- [Venmo](https://venmo.com/)
- [Snapchat Snapcash](https://support.snapchat.com/ca/snapcash)
{{% /columns %}}

Another advantage of these apps is paying friends back home to help out with something. I had a friend handle on my behalf back in the States, and with Cash I was able to pay him back instantly from Croatia — no dealing with wire transfers or figuring out how to get a check sent internationally.

### Don't Carry All Your Cards at Once {#money-diversify}

When I leave the house, I have one credit card, one debit card, one form of ID, and some cash. My other cards, ID, and cash stay in my apartment.

I *don't* have some secret cash pouch strapped to my body. I just carry my wallet and phone, and conduct my business like I would back in the States.

Muggers and pickpockets don't worry me much; I steer clear of situations where I'd be isolated, and I carry things in my hands instead of my pockets.[^carry]

    I actually carry my wallet in my hand, along with my phone and keys. I stopped carrying things in my back pocket years ago because it's bad for my posture, and I stopped using my front pockets after I noticed a phone-shaped wear pattern in a pair of jeans.

However, in the unlikely event that I *do* get mugged or pickpocketed, I have a backup card, a little cash, and a form of ID back at the apartment. And vice versa: if something happens at the apartment, I'm carrying cards, cash, and ID.

This is a small way of ensuring that things can only go *mostly wrong*. Kind of a physical manifestation of the "don't keep all your eggs in one basket" philosophy: don't keep all your assets in one pocket.

## Keeping in Touch While Abroad {#communication}

As we get ready to leave the country, it's a good idea to figure out how to keep in touch with people without paying a fortune for international calling.

While we're at it, we should figure out how to get a local number and access to wireless data.

### Keep a U.S. Phone Number that Works Internationally {#communication-us-number}

The first challenge I found myself up against was tricky: **how could my friends and family get in touch with me using a local U.S. number while I was outside the country?**

My mom can barely handle texting, so I couldn't just tell her to download a messaging app.[^mom-tech] Besides, my friends don't all agree on which app to use. Some prefer WhatsApp; others use Snapchat; and then there's the Facebook Messenger crowd. And I'm usually woefully unaware of which apps are trendy; there are probably lots more that I've never heard of.

[^mom-tech]:
    Asking my mom to do anything new with technology only ever ends with her in tears and me receiving a call from my very angry father.

I've resisted messaging apps[^whatsapp] because I prefer to do all my communication in one place: calls and texts. As I mentioned on [day 2]({{< ref "remote-work-course/day-2.md" >}}), I don't like having lots of notifications active on my phone, so having a half-dozen apps was less-than-ideal.

[^whatsapp]:
    I gave in and installed WhatsApp, which has been useful when we meet travelers who don't have local SIMs.

At first, I thought Google Voice would be the perfect solution: it allows for voice and texting (including MMS), and I'd be able to keep a U.S. number while abroad. Perfect!

Except I can't forward Google Voice calls to a foreign number — this means my Thai SIM card can't get a call from Google Voice.

Then I looked at Skype numbers. These were promising: I could forward calls to my Skype number to a foreign number.

Except Skype numbers don't support texting.

So — because having two numbers seemed like a giant pain in my ass — I worked up a complex solution to what should have been a simple problem:

1. Get a Google Voice number — this is what I give to my friends and family to call and text.
2. Get a Skype Number and set the Google Voice number to forward to it.
3. Set the Skype Number to forward to my local SIM's number.

This is complicated, but it's the only way I could find to get a U.S.-based number to function like a normal mobile number would.

### How to Get Free International Calling and Texting {#communication-international}

At first, I worried that I would have to choose between free[^free] calling within the country where I was staying, or free calling to the U.S.

[^free]:
    What I mean by "free" is "not charged at insane per-minute prices".

After a little digging, though, I realized I could have my cake and eat it, too. **Using [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), I could make free calls using wifi or mobile data to the U.S., and the caller ID would show my U.S.-based number.**

I could also send text messages (both SMS and MMS) on my phone.

It does require an extra app on my phone, but it doesn't require any of my friends to do extra work to keep in touch with me.

As far as my friends and family back in the States are concerned, nothing has changed about the way we communicate. I gave them my new Google Voice number, and no matter who dials, **no one has to worry about paying extra for the call.**

### Get a Local Number for the Country You're In {#communication-local}

Having a local number is really helpful when you want to make a reservation, book a tour, rent a car, or check the hours of a business. It's also good as a fallback for staying in touch with travel companions in case the network is too slow to send a message using data.

To get one, you'll need a local SIM card and an unlocked phone to plug it into.

**Further reading: [Carry-On Electronics Packing List]({{< ref "blog/carry-on-electronics-packing-list.md#work-and-entertainment" >}})**

When I needed to call or text locally, I would use my local SIM — which just meant calling with the normal Phone and Messages apps on my iPhone.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Keeping in Touch While Abroad]({{< ref "#communication" >}})</small>

### Use Free Video Calling Apps for More Personal Connection {#communication-video}

A standard complaint among people who travel long-term is that it gets lonely.

Not lonely in the traditional sense: you're surrounded by people. It's lonely in the sense that you're far away from anyone that you feel *close* to. And the odd phone call just doesn't seem to cut down on the isolation.

However, video calls seem to go a bit further toward creating a connection. Sure, nothing beats sitting down for a drink with a good friend, but seeing your friend on camera beats the hell out of sitting on your couch staring at a wall while you talk to them.

There are a ton of great options that offer a free way to connect with people on a video call.

If you're talking with a more tech-savvy friend, my favorite option is [Talky](https://talky.io/), which is a free, browser-based video chat.

Other options exist, but they require app downloads and/or plugin installs. Some of the most popular are [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/), and [FaceTime](http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/).

## Book Travel Cheaply and Easily {#booking}

With the enormous amount of information available about booking travel, it can feel a little overwhelming. Hundreds of sites will book your travel for you, and — unless you've got a friend who's used the service before — it's impossible to know if they're any good.

So part of becoming a full-time traveler means becoming a part-time travel agent.

Fortunately, that's *way* easier than it sounds.

### Stay Long Enough to Really Enjoy Each Place (and Save Money) {#booking-stay-longer}

The world is a big place, and the temptation when traveling is to try to stuff as much of it as possible into a vacation. People say things like, "I visited 8 countries in 6 days!" and show us photos and we're impressed, but did they really *do* anything in those countries other than sprint between photo-ops?

Think about where you live now. Your favorite places: you know the ones: the side-street bar where the [bartender taught you how]({{< ref "blog/how-to-drink.md" >}}) to make an Old Fashioned the right way; the [food cart with a menu so eclectic](http://www.carteblanchefoodcart.com/) you were sure it'd be gross, but it ended up being the best food you've ever eaten for $10 a plate; the [coffee shop](http://www.wateravenuecoffee.com/) that's perfect to work from and just happens to be across the hall from a tasty [ramen spot](http://bokebowl.com/). Oh, and the [other ramen spot](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mirakutei-portland).

Chances are, few of your favorite places have been your favorite places since your first week in town. And they most likely don't top must-see lists[^voodoo] on travel websites.

[^voodoo]:
    If you search "what to do in Portland", you'll definitely see Voodoo Donuts on every list. But most people living in Portland only go to Voodoo when their out-of-town friends are visiting. How many New Yorkers hang out in Times Square by choice? How many Londoners are fighting through crowds to see Westminster Abbey?

If you only see a city based on Trip Advisor's top attractions, you're not seeing the city; you're seeing *the tourists' version of a city.* Which, look, I've accepted that [being a tourist is okay sometimes]({{< ref "blog/navigating-the-tourist-trap.md" >}}) — but there's so much more to the city than its famous landmarks and whatever Anthony Bourdain did while he was there.

For me, this means that I want to stay in a city for at least two weeks, but preferably a month or more. Even that feels too short in a lot of cases.

With a month, you can see the tourist attractions *and* actually [get to know your neighborhood]({{< ref "blog/discover-a-new-city.md" >}}). Plus — remember, this isn't a vacation — a month means you have enough time to get work done without skipping bucket list activities or rushing to cram multiple things into a single day.

As an added benefit, staying for a month will often mean discounted rates for accommodations. An apartment that rents for $40/night might rent for $900/month, which — don't worry, I won't make you do math — is a 25% discount.[^buy-3-get-1]

[^buy-3-get-1]:
    Or, to put it in discount shopper terms: rent 3 months, get 1 free!

Working remotely means you can travel slowly. The goal of this whole thing, after all, is a *less stressful* lifestyle.

### Use Airbnb to Book Long-Stay Accommodations Hassle-Free {#booking-airbnb}

I'm a big fan of [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8), and so far in my travels I've booked all my apartments through the service.[^exceptions]

[^exceptions]:
    The only exceptions have been conferences where I've been put up in a hotel, and one night where I was booking last-minute and nothing was available in the part of town where I wanted to stay. (For that night, I used [HotelTonight](https://www.hoteltonight.com/).)

I like Airbnb for a few reasons:

1. It's typically cheaper than a hotel room.
2. Most listings are apartments, which means they're more suitable for longer stays than a hotel room.
3. You're usually dealing with a single owner, so communication is friendlier and less stressful than calling an anonymous help desk number.

Plus, you can find Airbnb listings in areas that don't have much to offer by way of hotels, such as the West Village in Manhattan.

The big benefit, though, is that you can filter based on amenities. Need a washing machine and a full kitchen? Airbnb will only show listings that have those. Want to have a hostel-like experience[^hostel] and live on the cheap? Rent a shared room.

[^hostel]:
    The appeal of a hostel continues to escape me. People talk about them so fondly: "you meet such great people", "it's so cheap", "you're bound to find something to do and a group to do it with".<br><br>I hear that, and I think, *damn, that sounds like fun!* And every few years, I decide I'll try it again.<br><br>All of my hostel experiences have gone something like this:<br><br>17:02 — I stuff my shit into a tiny cubby and lock it with a padlock I bought from the front desk at check-in. It occurs to me the key to the padlock is inside my bag. Which is now safely inside the cubby.<br>17:11 — The stoned teenager working the front desk isn't strong enough to use the bolt cutters, but seems reluctant to let me help.<br>18:29 — A group of twenty-year-old backpackers from Europe talks to me about "living life authentically" before complaining that their parents won't send more money after next week, so they'll have to go home, they guess.<br>18:37 — I eat dinner by myself after declining to join the backpackers for pre-dinner shots.<br>22:41 — I try to position myself on the top bunk in a way that will prevent me from A) snoring and B) plummeting to the concrete floor.<br>23:38 — A girl who's evidently still on Tokyo time chooses to deal with her insomnia by removing everything from her bag — by the sound of it, she's packed nothing but fun-sized potato chips and wrenches — and putting it back in again.<br>03:01 — A girl on London time follows Tokyo Time's lead. It sounds like she's packed bubble wrap and rusted hinges.<br>05:50 — I wake up sweating. There's no air conditioning and all the windows are closed.<br>05:53 — I take a cold shower and vow to never — *ever* — stay at a hostel again.

Plus, if you're staying for a month or more in each place, Airbnb hosts often offer discounts for longer stays. After all, they price with the expectation that the property will sit vacant for at least part of every month — you booking it solid ensures they're not losing money on unbooked weekdays.

If you've never used Airbnb before, [sign up here to save $25 on your first booking](http://www.airbnb.com/c/jlengstorf?s=8).

### Shop Locally for Cheaper Accommodations {#booking-local}

Talking to other people who travel full-time, the general consensus is that you can save extra money by looking for rentals in person. Many local folks don't know about or use Airbnb, so the cheapest rentals are usually found by wandering and asking around.

The strategy here, from what I've been told, is to rent a room for a few days at a hotel or hostel, then walk through the neighborhood looking for "for rent" signs.

A major benefit of this approach is that you can see the place — and the neighborhood it's in — before you agree to pay. The other benefit is that you can potentially save a few hundred bucks a month.

Personally, I've chosen to value "hassle-free" over "slightly cheaper", so if I can save 5% by doing a bunch of extra legwork, I'd rather just spend the extra 5%. For me, the ease of booking online — the familiar framework and mutual assurance an intermediary service provides — makes Airbnb worth paying a little extra, but if you're a deal-hunter, this may be worth looking into.

### How to Book Cheap Flights Without Wasting Time {#booking-flights}

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of booking sites that offer deals on flights. Depending on where you're planning to go, different sites will have better deals — so it makes sense to check them all when booking.

However, checking a dozen sites for cheaper flights is awful. It takes forever, and each of those sites will pepper you with ads and nonsense.

Fortunately, there's a much better way to find flights, and it doesn't involve paying extra or spending extra time. In fact, it'll *save* both time and money.

With [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/), you can check prices across dozens of booking sites quickly. Where it really shows its value, though, is with the calendar and map views.

When you search a flight, you can pull up the calendar and see the lowest price for each day of the month. In the case of JFK to LHR, the price fluctuates by hundreds of dollars throughout the month.

And if you're not sure where you want to go next, you can pull up the map view, enter your starting airport, and see cities you could visit next pop up along with the lowest-priced flight to get there.

So don't waste time going between Kayak, Priceline, Travelocity, and whatever other sites are advertising low prices. Use Google Flights (which searches those other sites, anyways) and get the cheapest flight possible in the least amount of time.

If you don't like Google, [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.net/) is a very similar service.

### Pay for Checked Baggage in Advance {#booking-checked-bags}

Airlines are all competing on price, and one of the ways they do that is by stripping away non-essential services from the base fare and turning them into add-on fees.[^scumbag] This is especially evident in Europe, where companies like Vueling, easyJet, and Ryanair offer flights for next-to-nothing.

[^scumbag]:
    The initial reaction to this may be, "Scumbag airlines keep adding new fees!" — but resist that urge. If charging for food means that my ticket gets a few dollars cheaper *and* I won't be handed some sugary, cookie-shaped, food-like product that I'll try (and fail) to stop myself from eating, I'm all for it.

Where they get you, though, is on little stuff you don't think about. You only get one bag, and if you don't pre-pay for the second one they nail you for 2–3 times the fee. Ryanair charges you to print your boarding pass (so do it beforehand). Little stuff that — at first — makes them seem like soulless profiteers. But really, they're removing all the excess to allow people who don't need it not to pay for it.

So, sure, they're maximizing profits, but they're doing it by lowering prices for savvy travelers. (That's you, by the way.)

But you need to read the details. What's the baggage limit? Do you need to print a boarding pass beforehand?

Make sure you know the deal, and you'll ensure that your airline deal *remains* a good deal.

### Keep Dates Flexible to Save the Most on Flights {#booking-flexible-dates}

Becoming location independent is all about freedom. An excellent use of your freedom is to travel on the days that work best for you *and* your wallet. If you can save $500 by waiting a couple days to fly, do it.

Take advantage of the Google Flights calendar view to see if there's a big fluctuation in price, and make sure you're not paying $500 for a flight on Friday that could be $200 for a flight on Monday.

The same applies to certain cities. Many places have "on" or "high" seasons, where tourism peaks and prices for just about everything spike. Sometimes, the high season makes a lot of sense: the lavender fields in Provence only bloom from June to August.

Other times, though, high season is just when the tourists show up.

On August 1, Rome looks a bit like the opening of *The Walking Dead*. You wander outside, but no one's there. There's no sign of trouble — things all appear normal — but the streets are deserted. Steel shutters stand closed, hiding bars and shops until nothing remains of the street but a steel corridor, littered with flyers from failing restaurants and little napkins from gelato shops.

Around a corner you hear shuffling. *Zombies aren't real,* you remind yourself, and step forward with a deep breath. In front of you, hundreds of dazed tourists amble along at a pace so slow it's practically reverse, eyes skyward, luggage somehow occupying the entire street in the shadow of the ruins of the Roman Empire.

Something catches a gentle breeze in the corner of your vision. One of the steel shutters has a piece of paper taped to it. The handwritten note reads, "*andati in vacanza fino al 1 settembre.*"

The reason the only people in Rome during August aren't from Rome is that — as far as I can tell, at least — the entire country of Italy takes August off from work and heads for the ocean. Those Italians who don't end up on the Amalfi coast show up in places like Split, Croatia, where August is a feeding frenzy for the tourism industry.

But July and September in Split — while a bit hotter and cooler, respectively — are just as nice. And significantly less crowded. And cheaper.

If you're interested in a place, find out when the peak seasons fall. Then find out *why*. And decide if the why matters — because if you go in the off-season,[^shoulder] you can save a fortune and see tourist attractions without the tourists.

[^shoulder]:
    The best times tend to be the "shoulder seasons" — this is when the weather changes. For example, November in Costa Rica is the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the nice season. If you go during November, you might see a little rain, but you'll also pay half (or less) for a hotel, and you'll have the beach almost entirely to yourself.

The takeaway from all this is to leverage your ability to work and live from wherever — and *when*ever — you want to save money and stress by booking flights and accommodations for when a destination is less expensive and less crowded.

## Avoid Travel-Day Hassles {#avoid-hassles}

If you're planning to travel internationally — especially if you've never done it before — there are a few gotchas that can really fuck up your day.

Fortunately, they're all pretty easy to avoid. Most of them don't even require preparation; just being aware of what can happen is typically enough to steer away from stressful travel-day scenarios.

### Get Familiar with the Schengen Area {#avoid-hassles-schengen}

When I first started planning my travel, I intended to spend all of 2015 in Europe. I had looked up how long I could stay in Spain, and 90 days was the limit.

So I looked up Italy. Again: 90 days.

*This is going to be so easy,* I thought. *I'll just jump from country to country every few months.*

But I had it wrong.

Yes, you can stay for 90 days in Spain. And you can stay for 90 days in Italy. *However,* both Spain and Italy issue the same visa — so I couldn't go straight to Italy after three months in Spain.

This was a serious wrench in my shit.

After a little more research, I learned that the Schengen Agreement created — among other things — a common visa for *all* EU countries.[^almost] This common visa applies to what's known as the [Schengen Area](http://bit.ly/1UUkS5m).

[^almost]:
    The Schengen Area consists of all EU countries *except* Ireland, the United Kingdom, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus. Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland are also part of the Schengen Area.<br><br>Ireland and the UK have opted out of common visas. The UK is really strict about their border, and Ireland didn't want to jeopardize its open border agreement with the UK. At least, this is what I was able to understand by skimming the Wikipedia article.<br><br>Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus are all supposed to join the Schengen Area in the near future. They just have to prove their infrastructure meets EU standards first.

This is really convenient when you're visiting, or when you live in the EU: you can move between Schengen Area countries the same way U.S. citizens move between states: no border control and no hassles.

But for the long-term traveler, this poses a challenge: after your 90-day visa is up, you need to stay out of *all* Schengen Area countries for a 90-day period before you can enter again.[^rolling]

[^rolling]:
    The specifics of this are kind of weird to understand. The 90 days are figured on a rolling basis, so you can be present for 90 of the last 180 days. The easiest way to look at this is to go exactly 180 days backward from today, then add up all the days you were in an EU country. Is it fewer than 90 days total? You're allowed to be there.

So if Europe is on your list, make sure your plans account for the Schengen visa. Depending on the time of year, you can jump over to Croatia or Romania for a less expensive option, or to the UK[^london] if you don't mind spending a little more on... everything.

[^london]:
    The UK is really only a good idea for long-term stay if you like being wet, cold, and broke.

Or, if you don't mind a longer flight, Asia has a lot to offer. I've found that splitting my time between southeast Asia and Europe has been ideal for me, both in terms of my happiness and my bank accounts.

### Check If You Need a Visa Before You Go {#avoid-hassles-visa}

As Americans, tourist visas are often just given to us when we show up. That stamp in your passport? That's a visa.

But not all countries work that way. Thailand, for example, requires you to apply for a visa beforehand[^voa] if you want to stay longer than 30 days, and Turkey requires you to get a visa online before you fly.

[^voa]:
    You can get what's called a "visa on arrival", but it involves yet another line in the airport, and there's no guarantee you'll actually get one — it's a low-risk gamble, but when there's a 24-hour, three-connection flight involved, I'm not willing to leave *anything* to chance.

These visas also cost money. They're usually cheap — $20 for a 90-day Turkish visa, $80 for a double-entry (180-day) Thai visa — and you'll save so much staying in the country[^thaifood] that it's absolutely worth paying.

[^thaifood]:
    On Ko Samui in September, we had two orders of panang curry with pork, one order of fried rice with pork, and two bottled waters. It cost us ฿170 — that's less than $5 to feed two people. And those prices aren't abnormally cheap, either.

Before you book your flight and apartment, figure out how visas work for the country you're visiting. A quick search for "tourist visa for ________" will usually do the trick.

If you need to apply for a visa in person, figure out where a consulate or embassy for the country is. Plan on being there for at least three days, just in case the processing takes longer than expected. And check for holidays in both the country you're planning to visit *and* the country you're trying to get a visa to enter. You don't want to show up and find out they're closed.

I'm making this sound scary, but it's really not. Just read the requirements, jump through the hoops, and enjoy your 3–6-month visit.

### Don't Get Worked Up About Security {#avoid-hassles-security}

I struggle with inefficiency. Because of this, the security line is a special kind of hell.

There's the this-is-my-first-airplane guy, who holds up the line for several minutes while he learns, item by item, that "remove everything from your pockets" means *everything*. Yes, even gum. Yes even your boarding pass. Yes, even... goddammit, dude, just turn 'em inside out!

And then there's the we-pack-by-stuffing-all-our-shit-into-tote-bags couple. He's unpacking his *entire* carry-on because the laptop is at the very bottom, and she's not sure which pocket the liquids are in. Also, is an iPad a laptop? Or can that stay in the bag?

Meanwhile, I've been holding my watch, belt, and shoes since the second switchback in the security line, and my bag is packed in such a way that my laptop and liquids are out within ten seconds of setting my bag in a bin.

Marisa looks at me with concern, and reaches out to touch my arm with the same care and caution she'd use to disarm a bomb. "It's okay. We've got plenty of time before our flight," she reassures me.

"I don't give a fuck about our flight. I give a fuck about these idiots not having the common courtesy to give a few seconds' forethought to how this might go," I spit at her. "I give a fuck that they're so solipsistic they don't even have the capacity to feel ashamed about it."

So it goes: I let inexperienced or inconsiderate travelers get under my skin, and my stress response skyrockets, and minutes or hours or days of my life are lost in a self-inflicted rage; casualties of a war I can't help but wage on my body, using my endocrine system as a chemical weapon.

Marisa's right, after all: it doesn't matter if the tourists in matching outfits empty their bags onto the floor, or if the first-timer has to three times before he gets everything out of his pockets. *It doesn't affect me.*

And I need to show a little empathy. I've been these people before. And I still am, on occasion.

In Costa Rica, I did my usual shoes-and-belt-and-electronics routine to get ready for security, and when I got to the front of the line, the security lady looked at me and said, "What are you doing? Put your shoes back on."

So I tried to put my shoes on quickly, but I was definitely holding up the line.

And I'm sure, somewhere behind me, a Costa Rican businessman's neck felt hot, and he checked his watch impatiently.

*¡Odio estos pinches turistas!*

### Be Ready to Prove You're Planning to Leave {#avoid-hassles-onward-travel}

When we go through customs in a foreign country, it's the customs agent's job to make sure we're not going to do anything illegal while we're there.

The big fear is illegal immigration: if I show up in London on a tourist visa, then take a job under the table and just... don't leave, I'm putting a strain on the British system. My illegal job means there's one less *legal* job; it means fewer taxes are paid; it means I'm probably renting a place illegally (again, fewer taxes).

It's a legitimate concern to have, but it also makes long-term travel a red flag for customs agents.

As part of ensuring you're not going to do anything untoward, some customs agents will ask for proof that you're planning to leave. They call this "proof of onward travel" — typically your flight out of the country.

Usually, this isn't a problem; just make sure you have the email ready to show at customs if they ask.

But if you're not sure when you're leaving yet, you probably won't have your flight booked. Which means you can't prove you're planning to leave. Which means — in extreme cases — you could be denied entry into the country.

I've never personally run into this issue. I've only ever been asked for proof of onward travel in the United Kingdom, whose customs agents have a reputation for being hardasses.

So this may not ever be an issue for you. However, if you're paranoid, you can "rent" an onward ticket using [FlyOnward](https://flyonward.com). In short, they work with a travel agency to book refundable tickets in your name, which are valid for 1–2 days. They're real flights, so the confirmation numbers check out, and the service is cheap: about $10 for a ticket.

Now, I've never actually used the service, but if you're going to the UK and haven't figured out when you're leaving yet, it may be worth a try.

### Be Ready to Prove You Can Afford Your Stay {#avoid-hassles-proof-of-income}

In addition to proving you're actually going to leave, you may be asked to show that you have enough money to afford your stay. After all, if you show up on a tourist visa with $10 in your pocket, no savings, and no return ticket, how the hell will you leave without illegally taking a job?

The requirements are low in most places. Thailand, for example, requires that you have ฿10,000 (about US $280) for every 30 days you plan to stay. Somewhere like London may expect a higher sum, but I haven't been asked.

It might feel like an invasion of privacy, but think of it more like a security deposit: if you're about to lend someone your $1,000 guitar, you want to be sure they've got $1,000 to replace it in case it gets destroyed, right? Same idea here.

So be ready to show your bank account balance. This doesn't happen often (I've only had to do it once), but it's a possibility.

### Don't Overshare with Customs {#avoid-hassles-overshare}

I once told a customs agent I was technically homeless.

He was not amused.[^amused]

[^amused]:
    Honestly, he must have been a little amused, because otherwise there's no way in hell I'd have been allowed in the country.

Remember the situation you're in: a customs agent can maek your life *really* hard for a day or two, so play along and be nice. If you rub the agent the wrong way, they might grill you a little harder, and if you slip up, you could find yourself held for extra questioning.

Be polite. Be honest. But be *brief*.

When you show up in a country and plan to be working, *but that work is technically being performed in another country*, you're not taking jobs from locals. When I work on a contract with a Canadian company that pays money into my U.S.-based bank account, I'm not stealing a job from a Thai citizen.

But I *am* working while in Thailand.

Does that violate the tourist visa? Honestly — it seems to depend who you ask. The location-independent workers of the world — the WFHers, the digital nomads, the remote workers — exist in an as-yet undefined legal space.[^change]

[^change]:
    I suspect this will change in the future. But for now, thanks to ambiguities in the way remote work is defined, workers like us seem to have fallen through the cracks. What we're doing is perfectly legal, as far as I can tell, and no one has refuted my claims with anything other than different interpretations of the same murky wording that led me to believe it was legal.<br><br>Since there aren't many people doing this, I doubt it's a high priority to clarify the language, but I expect we'll see it cleaned up within our lifetimes. So if you're planning to do this, do it now: who knows how long the big benefits (like tax breaks) will remain intact.

My personal stance on this is that as long as I'm putting money into a local economy and taking nothing out, I'm a tourist.

As far as the country I'm visiting is concerned, my money could just as well come from a trust fund, or a magic purse I won from a down-on-his-luck wizard; the point is that where I am has exactly *nothing* to do with how I make my living.

I believe this is logically correct, but I also hold no illusions about legal decisions being based in logic, so I take an incognito approach: I am a tourist; I am here on holiday; I do not plan to take a job in the country; I plan to leave before my tourist visa expires.

All of these statements are true. I leave out my internet-based business because global legislation hasn't caught up to the global economy. I don't want to engage government representatives in a rhetorical debate about where internet-based work "is" — so I keep my mouth shut and, if they probe about income, I show them my emergency fund to prove I can afford to be there.

## Learn About Tax Breaks Available to Long-Term Travelers {#taxes}

When I first started researching long-term travel, taxes were the biggest, shiniest lure. I read somewhere that I wouldn't have to pay *any* taxes if I left the country for a year.

Holy shit, right?

Now, it turns out that whatever I was reading was utter bullshit, but there *are* some big tax breaks available. If you're planning to spend at least 11 months outside the U.S. on your travels, this section is for you.

### Get an Accountant {#taxes-accountant}

I'm not an accountant, and this isn't accounting advice. Double-check anything you read here with a professional.

Everything in this section is my own interpretation of tax law, which I ran by two accountants to make sure I'm not crazy. They both agreed that my interpretation is theoretically correct.

Now, that being said, everyone's situation is unique, and things like property you own, which state you live in, and all sorts of details about your exact state of existence in the government's eyes can and probably will affect the accuracy of what I'm talking about here.

So don't just take this at face value. Go to an accountant. Get real tax advice from a real tax professional. The internet is full of liars, and while I believe what I'm writing here, I may be one of them.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Learn About Tax Breaks]({{< ref "#taxes" >}})</small>

### See If You Qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) {#taxes-feie}

This is the big break — if you qualify for it, you're able to exclude up to about $100,000 in income from federal income taxes.

That's almost $25,000 you *won't* pay in taxes if you qualify.

This is all made legal under the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)](http://1.usa.gov/1LBNgUS), which states that you qualify if:

1. You are outside the U.S. for a minimum 330 days in a 12-month period
2. You don't have a home in the U.S. (e.g. an apartment standing vacant, a home you own without renters)

There's [more to it](http://1.usa.gov/1NHpqNu), but if you meet those requirements you're in good shape.

What it all comes down to is where your "tax home" is, and whether or not your income is considered "foreign earned".

The tax home is pretty self-explanatory:

> If you have neither a regular or main place of business nor a place where you regularly live, you are considered an itinerant and your tax home is wherever you work. <small>Excerpt from ["Tax Home in a Foreign Country"](http://1.usa.gov/1LBNPhF)</small>

As for foreign-earned income, the language isn't crystal clear, but it leans in favor of remote workers qualifying:

> Foreign earned income is income you receive for performing personal services in a foreign country. [...] For example, income you receive for work done in France is income from a foreign source even if the income is paid directly to your bank account in the United States and your employer is located in New York City. <small>Excerpt from ["What Is Foreign Earned Income"](http://1.usa.gov/1LBNUln)</small>

So even if you're paid by a U.S. company into a U.S. bank account, the fact you're physically present in another country seems to qualify you for the exemption.

I checked my interpretation with two accountants, and both agreed that I'm interpreting the law correctly, and the exemption applies to remote workers.

I'll have to wait until my taxes are filed and accepted before I'm fully convinced, but for now, I'm cautiously optimistic.

### The FEIE Does NOT Exclude You from Self-Employment Tax {#taxes-self-employment}

If you're an independent contractor, or if you own your business, keep in mind that the FEIE doesn't get you out of *all* taxes — just *income* tax.

So you still owe [self-employment tax](http://1.usa.gov/1LBOEXD) (which covers Social Security and Medicare) optional. This is 15.3% of your income,[^irs] and you *will* have to pay it.

[^irs]:
    15.3% is the 2014 figure. I can't find any official mention of what the 2015 rate will be as of September 2015.

You only pay this tax on the first $117,000 you make. I think you're supposed to send it in quarterly to avoid extra fees, but I'm not 100% sure on this. Check with your accountant.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Learn About Tax Breaks]({{< ref "#taxes" >}})</small>

### Save Your Tax Money, Just in Case {#taxes-savings}

I'm not a worrier. No one I know would describe me by saying, "Well, Jason's the kind of guy who worries a lot." Because I don't.

But when it comes to large amounts of money, I'm a little gun-shy.

I learned this the hard way: when I first started freelancing, I didn't have a good concept of steady cashflow, so when I landed my first large job, I didn't think to save it for hard times. What I *did* think about was impressing my new girlfriend, so I booked a trip to Hawaii that included a swanky hotel room and convertible rental.

Later, in the depths of a dry spell, I realized that the "feast or famine" mythos that's handed down from freelancer to freelancer is mostly self-inflicted.

So now, where there's up to $25K on the line, I'm not going to book any expensive trips using my tax savings.

Instead, I'm keeping it in an interest-bearing account that I don't touch except to put more money in. I keep 31% of my earnings in the account — which I'm actually nervous is a bit low.

I look at it this way: if something unexpected comes up and I end up back in the U.S. before December 31, 2015, my FEIE claim may not work out. And if it doesn't work out, I'm going to owe my full income taxes — which, if I hit the max, means I'll need to come up with $25,000.

If that happens, I do *not* want to be stuck scrambling for jobs to dig myself out of that hole. And I certainly don't want to take out a loan to pay my taxes.

So instead, the money will sit and collect interest until I'm sure that no one else can lay claim to it.

I'd recommend you do the same. Think of it like building in a year-end bonus when your FEIE claim is accepted.

Be safe. Don't take chances with the IRS. Tax code is tricky, and you can never be sure you got it right until you get confirmation from the IRS.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Learn About Tax Breaks]({{< ref "#taxes" >}})</small>

### Learn About Tax Requirements in Your State {#taxes-state}

Depending on which state you're currently calling home, you may have some additional hoops to jump through tax-wise.

Even if your FEIE claim goes through, some states may still expect income taxes. The language is confusing, and the two accountants I talked to were both a little apprehensive about the situation.

Oregon, where I lived for most of 2014, has a policy that effectively claims that you "live" in Oregon until you establish a permanent residence somewhere else. Which puts me in a weird place, because I technically don't have a permanent residence.

So even with zero days spent in Oregon during 2015, they could potentially try to tax me as an Oregon resident.

This didn't sit well with me — it seems like they're playing dirty pool.

So instead, I moved in with my parents.

My parents live in Washington. So I brought them my box of legal documents I was hoping they'd keep safe for me. Then I got a Washington driver's license, registered to vote in Washington, and updated everything I have to my Washington address.

Logically, this all makes sense: if I'm going to be shipped back to the U.S. for any reason, I'd prefer that I showed up at my parents' house rather than at the apartment I no longer rent in Portland.

I'm also filing a partial-year tax return for Washington and Oregon, to let Oregon know I have *for sure* moved out of the state permanently.

So check with your accountant. Figure out how state taxes work where you live. And if you're in a state where they'll try to tax you even if you definitely don't live there or plan to return, see if you can become a resident of a [state that doesn't have income tax](http://intuit.me/1LBRJqA) before you leave.

### Seriously: Talk to an Accountant {#taxes-accountant-freal}

This money stuff is complex and confusing. Don't leave it up to chance. Go talk to an accountant, and give some serious thought to letting a professional handle it on your behalf.

Remember: I'm just some guy on the internet, and I have no professional qualifications to tell you how to manage your taxes. **DO NOT use any of this information without clearing it with a tax professional first.**

## Look into Insurance and General Ass-Covering {#insurance}

Just like when you're living in one place, it's a good idea to have a few safety measures in place. Sure, you can live by the seat of your pants, but when your roof starts to leak (or your luggage disappears), it's nice to know you're not *entirely* up a creek.

So this section goes over some travel-specific areas of insurance, safety nets, and general ass-covering. All stuff that you'll *hopefully* never need, but you'll be glad to have in the unlikely event you do.

### Get a Travel Health Insurance {#insurance-travel}

A travel health insurance policy is important, because it covers a lot of things that a standard policy typically doesn't. For example, medical evacuation isn't something you'll see on a standard insurance policay — but if you end up pretty sick in a developing country, you'll want to be evacuated.

Another, albeit more grisly, benefit is the repatriation of remains. If the worst happens, you don't want your family to end up spending a fortune trying to get you back home.

There are several options for travel health insurance. I ended up using [GeoBlue](http://bit.ly/1FTpbXJ) because I liked the benefits-to-cost comparison,[^health] and it's in the Blue Cross Blue Shield network.

[^health]:
    Honestly, I almost never go to the doctor. I've been to a walk-in clinic a couple times in the last four years. Aside from that, I went to the emergency room once when I was 99% sure I was going to die from food poisoning; the doctor told me — I'm paraphrasing here — to rub some dirt on it and quit whining, then sent me a bill for $1,400.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Look into Insurance and General Ass-Covering]({{< ref "#insurance" >}})</small>

### Consider a Supplemental Insurance Plan for Your Gear {#insurance-gear}

Something I looked into before leaving was a plan to cover my valuables: my laptop, phone, and so on.

This turned out to be pretty tricky — every quote I got back was insanely expensive for what it would cover.

So in my case, I decided to skip insurance on my gear. Instead, I set aside an all-my-shit-got-stolen fund, which will replace everything I absolutely need in order to keep going.

Now, this makes sense for me, because replacing my essentials — a laptop, a phone, and some clothing — would cost me about $3,000 tops. So if you're traveling with $30K in video equipment, an insurance policy is probably worth researching.

But if you're like me, rolling with nothing more valuable than a MacBook Pro, a cash reserve may hold its value better than a supplemental insurance plan.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Look into Insurance and General Ass-Covering]({{< ref "#insurance" >}})</small>

### Keep an Emergency Bailout Fund {#insurance-bailout}

I'm a firm believer in [setting yourself on fire]({{< ref "blog/set-yourself-on-fire.md" >}}). I think setting yourself on a do-or-die course is a great way to make sure you follow through on a commitment.

However, I'm also not about to put myself at risk of running out of money in Cambodia with no way to get home and no legal way of remaining in the country.

So I've put aside an emergency bailout fund. It's a few grand, which I look at as my emergency parachute. If I have to touch that, it's time to go home. If I'm going to go broke, I want to make sure I do it in a country where I can start applying for jobs without fear of deportation.

The bailout fund will ideally cover a flight home and a week or two of accommodations.[^emergency-fund]

[^emergency-fund]:
    This is not to be crossed up with a standard emergency fund, which gives you operating capital for a few months. The bailout fund is only intended to keep you out of a situation that could turn legally ugly, like going broke in a country where you can't legally work.

If you ignore everything else in this section, *do this*. Don't leave without a bailout fund in place.

### Keep Photos of Critical Documents in the Cloud {#insurance-cloud}

You never want to be without your ID documents. The problem with physical documents, though, is that they can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

So keep a secure copy of your documents somewhere in the cloud, where you can get to them on any computer with internet access. Use Dropbox, Google Drive, your email — anything that allows you to get to those docs even if everything you own is stolen.

What I'm currently using is [1Password](http://bit.ly/1Pbi7eg), which is fantastic for securely managing passwords,[^spy-movie] credit card information, bank accounts, ID documents, and anything else you want to keep encrypted. I have it on both my laptop and my phone, and it syncs with Dropbox.

[^spy-movie]:
    Tools like 1Password have ruined the spy movie genre for future generations:<br><br>The hero is tied to a chair. The villain weilds some horrible instrument of pain. In an ominously accented growl, he demands, "Tell me ze password, Mr. Bond."<br><br>And the hero will say, "I can't. It was randomly generated by my password manager."<br><br>*[sickening sound of something awful happening, followed by tortured cries]*<br><br>"What do you expect me to do," the hero manages to retort through gritted teeth, "take a wild guess at a randomly generated password with 128 bits of entropy?!"<br><br>"No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die."

In many cases, I've found my passport number — not the passport itself — is all anyone is after, which saves me the hassle of carrying my passport around all the time. Since I've got my passport info encrypted in my phone, I can just pull it up quickly.

In addition the 1Password storage, I also keep a scan of my passport. I think I have this out of sheer paranoia, honestly, but I figure it's a good thing to have for disaster scenarios.

### Back Up Files Using a Cloud Service {#insurance-backup}

Sometimes shit happens. Once I dumped an entire cup of coffee into the keyboard of my laptop, killing it instantly. Another time I dropped my phone with surgical precision to land screen-down on a pointy rock, also killing it instantly. Another time I was so worried about dropping my (new) phone in the toilet that I set it on the sink, where it fell in, got wet, and was killed instantly.

In each of those cases, I stood to lose important things: my laptop has all of my work files on it; my phone has contact information, photos, messages, and music.

But I back up all my files to the cloud (automatically), so in all three of the above cases, I was only out the device, not the data.

Wrecking a laptop sucks — it's a really stupid way to spend money — but losing the data would have threatened my career. My clients' files all would have needed to be rebuilt; that's not time I get to bill for. So I lose months of work, and have to make it all up — without falling behind in the process. It's just not tenable as a remote worker.

For that reason, it's *critical* to install some kind of automated cloud backup. I prefer [Dropbox](https://db.tt/gPmxlbE) because it's incredibly easy and reasonably priced, but there are multiple options out there, including [Google Drive](http://bit.ly/1NCtxsx) and [iCloud](http://apple.co/1PbkZYz).

If you're concerned about privacy, there are options to [beef up security on cloud storage](http://bit.ly/1PbnYQJ).

Once you set this up, your files will be automatically synced up to the cloud. This has the added benefit of allowing you to edit a document on your phone and have those edits immediately and automatically show up on your laptop.

It's an hour or so of hassle to set it up, and then you're just... done. And you don't have to worry about it again.

When I dumped coffee on my laptop, I swore loudly, went to Best Buy, bought a new laptop, installed Dropbox, and I was back up and running by the end of the day. Instead of days, weeks, or months of lost work, I was only out a few hours.

Cloud backups. Get 'em.

### Turn On Two-Factor Authentication for Your Accounts {#insurance-2fa}

If you've never heard of [two-factor authentication](http://bit.ly/1V21JE2) before, don't worry. You've probably already used it. You know how sometimes when you log into your bank or social accounts, they'll text you an authorization code? That's two-factor authentication.

The reason it's important is because while you're traveling, you never know which open wifi network has some shitbag connected that's eavesdropping on network traffic. It's really hard to be sure that someone hasn't gotten hold of your information.

However, it's pretty tough for someone to steal both your phone *and* all your passwords. So using two-factor authentication just adds an additional layer of hassle for would-be data thieves, which is typically enough to discourage them. Why bother with two-factor auth when you can go after the people who haven't turned it on instead?

Time-wise, it's a minor inconvenience: most apps will use Google Authenticator, which means you enter your password, then check the app for a six-digit code to confirm you have your device with you. Other services will text you or call you — if you use your Google Voice number as the confirmation number, you can verify those services anywhere in the world.

Check your accounts — especially your email, social, and bank accounts — and turn on two-factor authentication in the settings. If you're not sure how, a quick Google search or help chat will get you pointed in the right direction.

This is a good idea whether or not you're traveling, so take the time to set it up today. These days, letting someone take over your email account is probably more destructive than letting them have your social security number — they can reset all your passwords, lock you out of all your accounts, and generally wreak utter havoc on your on- and offline existence. Don't take the chance.

### Use a VPN While Browsing the Internet {#insurance-vpn}

A VPN, or *virtual private network*, is a way to encrypt all your information that's sent through the internet. In short, it makes sure that if you're on an open wifi network, someone with sinister intentions can't intercept the things you're sending and receiving from your browser.

The reason most people get a VPN is to work around geographical restrictions on sites like Netflix, but they're worth much more than that.

I use [TunnelBear](http://bit.ly/1V22vRf) because it's cheap and really easy to use on both my laptop and phone. Plus they have all sorts of bear animations, and I like bears.

<small>Jump to: [Table of Contents]({{< ref "#contents" >}}) | [Look into Insurance and General Ass-Covering]({{< ref "#insurance" >}})</small>

### Keep Original Documents Somewhere Safe {#insurance-original-documents}

Documents you don't need — birth certificate, Social Security card, etc. — shouldn't be kept in your luggage. Put them in a lockbox at a bank, in a loved one's safe, or with your lawyer or accountant for safekeeping.

If someone steals your passport, it's best that they don't also have all of your other ID documents as well.

Outside the U.S., most ID documents won't help you much anyways, so don't take the risk of carrying your entire identity paper trail in one bag.

### Set Up Mail Forwarding, Not a P.O. Box {#insurance-mail-forwarding}

For some services, like bank accounts, you can't use a P.O. box. So just setting up a P.O. box before you leave may put you in a tough spot later on.

You can easily work around that, though, by setting up a mail forwarding service.

I found a local place in Washington that offered a "virtual mailbox" service, which essentially means my mail goes to them, and they forward it wherever I tell them to. For now, I forward my mail to my parents, which is fine because I've received about one piece of mail every three months that actually requires any action.

If you don't want to burden your family and friends, there are companies that do this for you, including scanning mail, shredding items, and other mail-related tasks. I haven't used them myself, but some of the popular choices are [Traveling Mailbox](http://bit.ly/1V23yRa), [Mailbox Forwarding](http://bit.ly/1V23C3F), and [Earth Class Mail](http://bit.ly/1V23D7H).

If you decide to purchase something I recommend here, that means the price for you is the same (or cheaper), and I get a small kickback from the company. I use all this stuff myself, so I can vouch for the quality. If you'd rather not use my affiliate links,  though, you can Google the products instead.
